<h2 id="c1">HOW TO KNOW THE TREES</h2>
<p>The best time to begin to study the trees is
to-day! The place to begin is right where
you are, provided there is a tree near enough,
for a lesson about trees will be very dull unless
there is a tree to look at, to ask questions of, and
to get answers from. But suppose it is winter
time, and the tree is bare. Then you have a
chance to see the wonderful framework of trunk
and branches, the way the twigs spread apart on
the outer limbs, while the great boughs near
the trunk are almost bare. Each branch is trying
to hold its twigs out into the sunshine, and
each twig is set with buds. When these buds
open, and most of them send out leafy shoots,
the tree will be a shady summerhouse with a
thick, leafy roof that the sun cannot look through.
Among the big branches near the trunk very few
leaves will be found compared with the number
the outer twigs bear.</p>
<p>How can we tell whether the tree is alive or
dead in winter? Break off a twig. Is there a
layer of green just inside the brown bark? This
is the sign that the tree is alive. Dead twigs
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
are withered, and their buds are not plump and
bright. The green is gone from under the bark
of these twigs.</p>
<p>Under each bud is the scar of last year&rsquo;s leaf,
and if you look on the ground you are pretty
sure to find a dead leaf whose stem fits exactly
into that scar. If there are a number of these
leaves under the tree, you may feel sure that they
fell from the tree last autumn. Look carefully
among the leaves, and on the branches for the
seeds of this tree. If there is an acorn left on
the tree, you may be sure that you have the tree&rsquo;s
name!</p>
<p>The name is the thing we wish first to know
when we meet a stranger. If an acorn is found
growing on a tree, that tree has given us its
name, for trees that bear acorns are all oaks.
An acorn is a kind of nut, and there are many
kinds of oaks, each with its own acorn pattern,
unlike that of other oaks. Yet all acorns sit in
their little acorn cups, and we do not confuse them
with nuts of other trees. So we know the family
name of all trees whose fruits are acorns. They
are all oaks, and there are fifty kinds in our
own country, growing wild in American forests.
But if those of all countries are counted, there
are in all more than three hundred kinds.</p>
<p>If, instead of acorns, pods hang on the twigs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
the tree belongs to the locust family, related to
our garden peas and beans. The signs by which
we learn to know trees are not many. The bark
of the white birch is so silky white that everybody
knows that tree. The sycamore sheds its
bark in thin, irregular sheets, leaving patches of
dirty white streaking the trunk and limbs, as if
the tree had been daubed and spattered with
whitewash. This tree is so strikingly different
from others that nearly everybody knows it by
name. Or they call it &ldquo;buttonwood.&rdquo; The seed-balls
hang on slender stems, swinging in the
winter wind.</p>
<p>The winter signs to notice are the bark, the
buds, and the leaf scars, the shape of the tree,
and the way it branches. The fruit it bears may
be seen in summer, autumn, or winter. The
flowers come in warm weather, some kinds early,
some later, and the leaves are new in spring,
and most trees shed them in autumn. There is
no time of year when there are not three or
four of the important signs hung out on every
tree to guide those who are trying to find out its
name, and learn the story of its interesting life.
And the finding out of tree names is not dreary
and hard, but a good game to be played out-of-doors.</p>
<h2>TREE STUDIES IN THE AUTUMN</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<h3 id="c2">THE SHAGBARK HICKORIES</h3>
<p>The best hickory nut tree that grows wild
in our American forests is the shagbark,
or shellbark. Who says that the pecan is better
than the nut of the little shagbark? Southern
people insist upon this, as the pecan is the pride
of the Southern states. As a compromise we
may place side by side the pecan of the South,
and the little shagbark of the North, and challenge
the world to produce a nut that is worthy
to rank with these two in quality.</p>
<p>The shagbark takes its name from the tree&rsquo;s
habit of shedding the bark in long, narrow strips
or flakes, that curl away from the point of
attachment, but cling for months, perhaps, giving
the trunk a shaggy appearance, and making very
easy the discovery of these trees in a stretch of
mixed woodland. And how it does cut and slash
the stoutest of overalls to scramble up and down
one of these trees? Only boys and their despairing
mothers can know just how costly a
Saturday afternoon nutting expedition can be,
and why many a boy finds it expedient to come
back with his bag of nuts in the late dusk.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Otherwise he might be mistaken for a tramp,
so tattered are his clothes.</p>
<p>The smooth little nuts are angled and pointed,
and when they are ripe, the thick, corky, green
husks part into four equal divisions, and the nuts
fall out. So much less trouble than walnuts, in
their spongy husks, that never part regularly,
but wait until they are torn off by impatient
boys or squirrels, or until they dry and gradually
crumble away.</p>
<p>The shagbark hickory is a beautiful tree when
covered with its shining foliage in summer.
Each leaf is made of five leaflets on a wiry leaf
stem. The three outer leaflets are larger than
the pair set nearest the base of the stem. The
whole leaf is often more than a foot long, and
sometimes there are seven leaflets on each.</p>
<p>The most wonderful shagbark hickory tree I
ever saw was one I met once at sundown, after
a long walk across country. It stood in a field,
alone, and so near my home that I had noticed it
almost every day through a long winter. I had
gathered a quantity of nuts as they fell in the
frosty autumn days, and it was a race between
me and the squirrels, often, to see who should
get the bigger share. I think they beat me, which
is perfectly right. I remember now how rich
the foliage looked as it slowly turned from green
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
to golden brown, and fell in a great windrow all
about the shaggy trunk, as the nuts ripened.</p>
<p>All winter I noticed how strong the lithe limbs
were, and how flexible, as the wind twisted them
about in storms, and how much of promise there
was in the great, scaly buds that tipped the twigs.</p>
<p>It was late April when I came by. As I looked
up into that tree top the sunlight was shining
through, and at first I thought I must be dreaming.
Instead of buds, I saw what seemed like
lighted candles, each with a silken frill, like the
recurved petals of an iris, below the tip of flame!
I had never seen a tree thus illuminated, and the
sight was enchanting. The warm spring air had
brought out the hickory buds, with those of other
trees, and while I was looking for flowers on the
ground, the buds above had swollen, cast off the
winter covers, revealing the silky inner wrappings
of the young shoots. The rich downward-curving
&ldquo;petals&rdquo; were only the inner scales of the
great buds, grown long and wide, their vivid
orange setting off the compact yellow buds that
still stood erect. These concealed the tender,
velvety leaves that were soon to be revealed with
the falling of the leaf scales. I had never seen
a hickory tree opening its iris-like buds before,
but I have never missed it since.</p>
<p>The big shellbark, or shagbark, hickory is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
sturdy &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; of the little shagbark. In
every particular it exaggerates the characteristics
of the favourite among our nut trees. The bark
is more shaggy, the tree grows larger, the nuts
are bigger. Are they <i>better</i>? No. But they
are much the same in flavour, and being so good
and so big, they have the market name of &ldquo;king
nuts.&rdquo; The best of them are gathered in the
woods of Missouri and Arkansas. The tree is
found from Pennsylvania westward to Oklahoma,
but the lumber is valuable for the making
of vehicles and tool handles, and so the trees are
now scarce in the states that are oldest.</p>
<p>In winter the big shagbark trees show their
orange-coloured twigs. They are peculiar to this
one hickory. The leaf stems stay on the twigs
after the leaves fall, and give the tree top in
winter a ragged, hairy appearance, that matches
its shaggy trunk.</p>
<h3 id="c3">THE DISAPPOINTING HICKORIES</h3>
<p>The pignut has been given this ugly name
because farmers, in the early days, turned their
pigs into woodland pastures to fatten on the
thin-shelled nuts that dropped from this kind of
hickory tree. They are not bitter, but merely
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
tasteless, and it is only a &ldquo;greenhorn&rdquo; from
town or city who will spend time to gather these
poor hickory nuts, mistaking them for shellbarks.
They are not usually angled, but smoothly
rounded, often pear-shaped, and the husks are
thin. The shagbarks are in husks nearly one-half
inch thick, which split in four divisions, and
fall apart to release the ripe nuts. The husks
of pignuts divide but part way down, and so
the nuts are not freed from them promptly. The
kernels are yellowish white.</p>
<p>A look at the bark of a shagbark hickory, and
then at a pignut fixes in mind one of the chief
differences between these trees. The pignut has
clean, smooth, grey bark, becoming coarser and
rougher with increasing age, but never shedding
its bark in ragged strips as the shagbark begins
to do when the trees are still young. Smoother
foliage and twigs, smaller buds in winter, and a
more regular round head make the pignut a fine
tree to plant on the lawn, where the shagbark
would be out of place, on account of its shaggy,
untidy trunk.</p>
<p>Another handsome hickory tree with nuts that
are very disappointing to the members of a nutting
party is the mockernut, called also the big
bud hickory, and the white heart hickory. The
last name is wrong because the heart wood is
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
brown, and it is the wood near the bark that
is white. The tree has the largest buds and the
stoutest, clumsiest twigs and branches in the
whole hickory family. The leaves are correspondingly
large, sometimes nearly two feet long,
of seven to nine leaflets, on downy, swollen stalks.
The catkins of the staminate flowers are like
thick, chenille fringes, six inches long, often
longer, hanging in May below the new leaves.</p>
<p>The nuts are large and look most promising
at first. The big, four-parted husk is as thick
as a shagbark&rsquo;s, but it does not split all the way
down. So the first difficulty is to get the nut out
of the husk. The bony shell is the next. It is
astonishingly thick and hard to crack. Last disappointment
of all, the kernel is at best very small,
and not worth the trouble of getting it out, though
there is no denying that it is better-tasting than
a pignut, and almost as sweet as a little shagbark.
Very often the shell contains a spongy
substance that is tasteless, instead of the kernel
the patient nutter has a right to expect.</p>
<p>Crumple leaflets of this tree in your hand, and
they smell fruity, like an apple. They turn to
yellow and russet in autumn.</p>
<p>The bitternut is a hickory nut whose kernel
no squirrel eats. It is as bitter as gall. Thin-shelled
as a pignut, and usually less than an inch
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
in length, the nuts are enclosed in thin husks,
that differ from others in having thin ridges that
rise along the four lines where they split at the
time the nuts are ripe. Two of these clefts run
farther down than the other pair. The nut shell
is thin, slightly flattened sometimes, and marked
with dark lines. The kernel is white, and you
will never taste a second one.</p>
<p>The sure sign by which to tell the bitternut
hickory is the tapering, flattened, yellow bud. At
any time of year a few, at least, of these buds
are to be found. They are numerous from midsummer
till May; after that, a few dormant
winter buds remain to tell the tree&rsquo;s name until
the new buds are showing in the angles between
leaf and twig No other hickory has little, yellow
buds.</p>
<p>In winter the slimness of the twigs, and in
summer the small size of the leaflets make this
the most delicately built of the hickories. The
buds are the smallest to be found on a hickory
tree. Yet it is the quickest to grow, and one
of the handsomest trees in the family. Because
it loves best to grow with its roots in wet soil,
it is called the swamp hickory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<h3 id="c4">THE BLACK WALNUT</h3>
<p>No boy or girl who has ever gone nutting &ldquo;in
brown October&rsquo;s woods&rdquo; can forget the fruits of
the black walnut trees that hang like green
oranges, high up on the ends of the branches,
and have to be climbed for and shaken down.
And each fellow on the ground looks out for
his own head, as the shower of nuts comes down.
Oh! the rich, walnut smell of those juicy husks,
as we bruised them on the nearest stone, tore
them off, wiping our damp fingers on the grass,
before cracking the rough-shelled nuts. The
brown stains stayed until they wore off, but the
memory of the sweet kernels lasts longer, and the
pungent odour of those nut husks is in every twig,
bud, and leaf of every walnut tree. Bruise any
young shoot, and by the odour of its sap the
tree&rsquo;s name may be guessed.</p>
<p>There is another test for a walnut tree, for
those who do not know the odour of the sap.
Cut a twig, and split it. The pith of walnut
trees is not solid, but is in thin plates, separated
by air spaces. This is a sure sign.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">Black walnut and butternut. Twig of butternut, in winter and in spring</span></p>
</div>
<p>Walnut trees grow rapidly, and are a valuable
tree crop to plant. Nuts for seed are packed in
gravel, and left outdoors over winter. The stubborn
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
shells are cracked by Jack Frost in such a
way as not to injure the seed, which is the meat
of the nut. The nuts are planted in spring just
where the trees are to stand, for it is much better
for a walnut tree never to be transplanted.</p>
<p>I have heard my grandfather tell how the early
settlers in Ohio cleared the rich bottom land
along the rivers. The great trees that had
grown, undisturbed, for centuries, were the
&ldquo;weeds&rdquo; that had to be cut down and removed,
before the soil could be ploughed and sowed to
oats or wheat. The only way to do this was
to burn the trees, by piling them together and
firing the pile, as soon as it was dry enough to
burn. The &ldquo;log-rollings&rdquo; were the neighbourhood
gatherings, when men brought their teams
and log chains, and worked like Trojans, dragging
the logs to the places selected for the giant
bonfires, later on. The women and children had
a grand time, watching the men at work, and
preparing the dinner, which was a feast, and a
great social occasion.</p>
<p>The stump of many a noble black walnut tree,
cut down a century ago, has stood, undecayed,
until recent years. So valuable is its wood that
these stumps have been pulled up with expensive
machinery, for the gnarly-grained roots that are
still sound. Cut into thin sheets, the wood is
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
used for veneering furniture. Think how many
millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of lumber went up in
smoke in those bonfires! Black walnut is scarce
now, and can hardly be bought at any price.</p>
<h3 id="c5">THE BUTTERNUT</h3>
<p>The butternut trees are stripped of their fruit
in October by boys who have visions of long
evenings, such as Whittier describes in &ldquo;Snow
Bound,&rdquo; with nuts and apples and cider, by a
roaring fire. Some boys leave the black walnut
trees to others, and fill their bags entirely from
the low, broad butternut trees, that have more
nuts in each cluster, and they are not so hard
to reach. Many will say that they are much
sweeter and richer than black walnuts. Others
do not care for them because they are so oily.
Indeed, they are called &ldquo;oil-nuts,&rdquo; and woe to
the youngster who has eaten &ldquo;all he wanted&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The butternuts are oblong and pointed at one
end, and sticky to the touch, differing in this
particular from the globular fruits of the black
walnut. The same clammy feeling makes it unpleasant
to touch the leaves of butternut tree.
The resinous sap seems to ooze out through pores
along the hairy leaf veins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>In summer time, when the fuzzy, green butternuts
are scarcely larger than olives, and their
shells are so soft that a knitting-needle goes
through without any trouble, the time for making
pickled nuts has come. The gathering of the
clustered green fruit is fun, but as soon as they
are scalded, the &ldquo;fur&rdquo; has to be rubbed off of
each, before the nuts, husks and all, are put down
in spiced vinegar, to be used as a relish for serving
with meats the following winter. The &ldquo;furring&rdquo;
usually falls to the children, and they get
very tired, for it is a slow and monotonous job,
whether one uses a coarse towel or a brush.
However, it would be unpleasant to eat a furry
nut, no matter how carefully the spicing was
done.</p>
<h3 id="c6">THE ENGLISH WALNUT</h3>
<p>The English walnut trees are grown in
orchards in Southern California. These trees
are quick to grow, and come early into bearing.
When you buy a pound of these thin-shelled nuts
at the corner grocery store, you may well wonder
where they grew. Perhaps little children picked
them up under trees that grow in Italy or in
Greece. Fine, large nuts come from France, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
none of them are raised in England. Many of
the best nuts are raised in California, where more
and more trees of this kind are planted each year.
They grow in the Southern states, but have never
been planted on a large scale as a commercial
nut tree.</p>
<p>The English walnut tree grows in England,
but the nuts never have time to get ripe in that
climate. They are gathered green, and pickled,
husks and all. From English grandmothers we
learned to pickle our own butternuts while the
shells are still soft.</p>
<p>The earliest shipments of the walnuts of
Europe came into this country from England.
Probably merchants in London sent them to
merchants in New York. The dealers did not
ask where these walnuts grew, but told people
who asked that they came from England. This
explains the name by which everybody now calls
them.</p>
<p>Far back in its history, this tree grew wild in
Persia, and on the wooded hillsides of Asia
Minor. The people gathered the nuts for food.
It was the custom of visitors to send presents of
these nuts back to their friends in Europe when
they were travelling in the Orient, and discovered
how very good these unknown nuts tasted. Englishmen
were among these who were loud in
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
praise of them. &ldquo;Walnut,&rdquo; the name they gave
the trees, means &ldquo;a nut that comes from a foreign
country.&rdquo; The Greeks had called it &ldquo;Jove&rsquo;s
acorn,&rdquo; for they could not think of any other
name good enough. Kings sent presents of nuts
to each other. Then people began to plant nuts,
instead of eating them all, and gradually all the
warmer countries of Europe found they could
grow these walnuts.</p>
<p>The size and quality of the nuts improved
under cultivation. Now there are many varieties,
all larger, thinner-shelled, and better-flavoured
than the original wild nuts that still grow in the
forests of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>In the centuries when the countries of Europe
were always at war with their neighbours, another
reason for planting walnut trees was discovered.
No wood was so good for gunstocks.
No young man could marry until he had planted
a certain number of walnut trees. This was the
law in some countries in the seventeenth century.
So multitudes of these trees were set out. Besides
gunstocks, walnut wood was much in
fashion for handsome furniture. A walnut forest
was a very profitable crop to raise, for lumber
alone. A tree that bore such nuts, while its
trunk was growing big enough to go to the saw
mill was doubly profitable. The people of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
colder countries were ambitious to share in this
prosperity. But an occasional winter of extra
severity killed the young trees.</p>
<h3 id="c7">THE CHESTNUT AND CHINQUAPIN</h3>
<p>Next to the hickory nuts, we must rank the
chestnuts. Some may give them first place in
the list of American nut trees. In England the
chestnut trees one hears about are never praised
for their nuts. English boys and girls do not
eagerly plan for half-holidays spent in the jolly
sport of chestnutting. Their chestnut trees turn
out to be very familiar to our eyes. They are
the horse chestnuts that we see so often at home.
Their nuts are handsome enough, and quite worth
gathering for use in some games, and just to have
and to handle. But chestnutting! That is one
of the great joys of October in our country, a
thing no boy or girl would miss without bitter
disappointment.</p>
<p>While the leaves turn yellow on the big trees,
children and squirrels have their eyes on the
clustered, spiny balls at the ends of the branches.
&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; is the sign they read as plain as
printed words. Warm days come and go, and
the tree holds out its sign, even after the leaves
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
begin to fall. Father and mother say: &ldquo;Be
patient!&rdquo; But they do not remember how hard
that is. It is a long time since they were eight
and ten and twelve years old.</p>
<p>Then a cold night comes, and in the early
morning a hoar frost is disappearing as the sun
rises. Four seams can be seen on some chestnut
burs, and the impatient boys throw clubs into
the tree tops. But their fingers are sore with
trying to pry the burs open. The nuts are cheesy
and insipid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you wait a spell.&rdquo; This is the
advice of John, the raggedy man, who does
the chores. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hurry up chestnuts.
When they&rsquo;re ready, I&rsquo;ll take you where you can
get a barrel of &rsquo;em, and not kill yourself, nor
ruin your hands gettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.&rdquo; He sees the rising
tide of fear before it is expressed in words, and
answers mysteriously: &ldquo;Nobody knows the place
but me. Let the little fellers an&rsquo; the town folks
hunt for nuts under the trees along the road.
They&rsquo;ll get a quart apiece, mebby, if they work
half a day. The place I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to, you can
scoop &rsquo;em up in handfuls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trees far back from the high road are
certainly more generous to the few who find them
than are the more accessible, and therefore more
popular trees. Nobody &ldquo;scoops them up in
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
handfuls,&rdquo; literally, for there are the burs, quite
as prickly as before they split their four segments
apart, and let the two or three nuts fall out.
Careful and quick motions are needed to pick up
the pointed nuts among the larger burs. But the
game is most absorbing. If the bags fill slowly,
there is the consoling thought that the shells are
thin, and the nuts are almost solid meats. The
busy picker stops now and then to sample a
few. They certainly are riper and finer tasting
than they were a short week ago.</p>
<p>Unopened or partly opened husks are often
gathered. The nuts will ripen and roll out on
the attic floor, or on the roof of the side porch.
Few parties who go chestnutting content themselves
with the loose nuts they gather. The end
of the day is a scramble to fill the bags or baskets
with hulls not yet fully open. Mittens faced
with leather or made of canvas are a good protection
for the hands.</p>
<p>The saddest news from the woods of the Northeast
is that a disease that baffles the tree doctors
has attacked and killed all the chestnut trees in
the neighbourhood of the city of New York,
and it is marching steadily westward. It has invaded
New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A fungus
attacking the living layer under the bark of a
tree is working where no remedy can reach it.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
The tree loses vitality, but only when it is far
gone does the disease break through the bark,
and show itself as small, yellow pimples on the
smooth bark of the branches. Out of these openings
the spores escape,&mdash;minute germs of the
disease. The wind scatters them. So do birds,
insects, and squirrels. They lodge in cracks in
the bark of other trees. Only chestnut trees
catch the disease, though the germs fall everywhere.
When it progresses far enough to produce
a mat of fungus that encircles the trunk,
the tree is girdled, its food supply is cut off, and
death results.</p>
<p>The chinquapin is a Southern tree, which
closely resembles the chestnut. It is usually
shrubby and dwarfed in all of its parts. The
nuts are about as large as our little hazel nuts,
and each is alone in a spiny husk that parts into
halves when mature. Five or six of these little
burs are often borne on a single stalk.</p>
<p>In Arkansas the tree reaches medium size,
but in the East it is familiar as a scrubby tree
that sends up suckers from the roots and forms
thickets, like hazel brush. Poor folks in the
South have time to gather these little nuts, which
appear on market day in their season in some
cities and towns. They are sweet, and some
people think they are better than chestnuts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h3 id="c8">THE BEECH</h3>
<p>Least of all the nuts good to eat that grow in
our mixed woods is the fruit of the grey-trunked
beeches. In nutting time the beech tree&rsquo;s crown
of green is almost as clean and bright as in midsummer.
The silky leaves are little torn by the
wind. They turn to a beautiful pale yellow, and
become thin and papery as the green pulp is
drawn back into the twigs. Few people see the
spiny green burs on the ends of side twigs in
summer, even though the crop of nuts be heavy.
In the autumn the brown spiny husks open.
Their four divisions flare outward, and two triangular
brown nuts are released. Almost unnoticed
they drop on the ground under the tree.
They are so little that the wind helps to scatter
them in the woods around. The shifting leaf
carpet sifts them through, and we shall have to
hunt for them, even under the parent trees.</p>
<p>I need not tell any boy or girl how good and
sweet these beech nuts are, and how well they
repay the trouble of getting the kernels out of
the thin, triangular shells. Yet people gather
them less frequently than they do chestnuts, because
it is slow work, and there is more accomplished
under trees whose nuts are larger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The early settlers fattened their pigs in autumn
by turning them into the woods. Beech trees
made the best possible pasture for this purpose.
The flavour of beech nut bacon is exceptionally
delicate, and has an extra high market value.
Squirrels and all of the smaller furry-coats take
the time and trouble to gather and hoard quantities
of beech nuts among their winter stores.</p>
<p>Fortunate for the beech tree, its nuts will grow
even in the shade. We shall find a fruiting beech
tree surrounded by its children&mdash;saplings of all
ages, coming up from seeds of various sowings.</p>
<p>By scratching carefully among the dead leaves
in spring, we shall find, among the gaping burs,
the young trees at the very beginning of their
lives. The nuts have slipped down into the damp
leaf mould, and the melting of snow, and the warm
spring air have started them growing. The triangular
shell clings to the top of the stem, while
the root is getting a foothold. A pair of broad
seed leaves, totally unlike the leaves of the
beech tree, unfold. The spreading of these seed
leaves soon splits the walls of the nut-shell helmet.</p>
<p>Little beech trees at this age are very weak
and helpless, but patient and struggling. Their
pale leaves turn green as the root goes deeper
down, and draws food from the soil. A shoot
bearing true beech leaves rises from the tip, between
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the seed leaves. The stem straightens, and
grows tall, the seed leaves wither, and, unless
it has bad luck, or some accident befalls it,
the little tree is a long, leafy whip by the end of
the season, and under each green leaf is a long
bird&rsquo;s-claw beech bud, just like those on the
parent trees. In these buds are leafy shoots
which will be side branches during the following
summer.</p>
<p>Beech nuts are still one of the main foods of
many wild animals. In the earlier days they had
much greater importance, for nuts were one of
the natural foods upon which the human race
subsisted before the days when men became civilised.
They depended upon foods which Nature
provided, and ate them without cooking. Acorns
served the same important purpose.</p>
<p>We cannot go back to the days when men lived
in caves, and dressed in the skins of wild animals,
and lived upon foods like nuts and berries, and
the flesh of wild beasts. But in camping out we
return as closely as possible to the simple life
of these wild ancestors of ours. It is good to
know what foods the forest offers to hungry
men and beasts. Some day we may be lost in
the woods. We may come to an oak tree, and
attempt to eat its acorns, but find them bitter. It
is well to know that the oaks with finger-pointed
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
leaves bear acorns that are sweet and good. It
is only the oaks with spiny-lobed leaves whose
acorns are bitter and unfit for food. Beech trees
offer no food to a hungry person, unless he
knows how little the nuts are, and how they
hide by slipping under the leaves when they fall.
To know trees is delightful at any time, and in
any place. To know them when one is lost in
a forest is often the means of saving one&rsquo;s life.
The forest still feeds the hungry, but only those
who know the trees are able to find these stores
of food when they need them.</p>
<h3 id="c9">THE WITCH HAZEL</h3>
<p>The witch hazel is indeed the witch of the
woods. It turns the year up-side-down, by blossoming
in October, at the same time that it is
ripening its seeds. For this reason every child
who lives in a region where this little tree grows
should know the witch hazel. The better people
know it, the more wonderful they find it. It
has many odd habits and secrets, which it will
reveal only to those who come and ask questions,
and keep their ears and eyes wide open to catch
the answers.</p>
<p>In spring the witch hazel hides under its green
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
leaves, and attracts no attention from those who
have come out to see the great procession of the
spring flowers, under foot, and over head. It
is simply a part of the undergrowth, a shrubby
little tree. But come in October, to the same
place. The acorns are dropping from the oak,
the foliage ablaze with colour, or faded and falling.
There are no flowers overhead, but a few
belated asters and goldenrods under foot. Squirrels
are busy hiding winter stores, gathered under
the nut trees, and on the wild hawthorns.</p>
<p>A thicket of witch hazel is slowly dropping
its yellowing leaves. You might not have noticed
it at all, had not one of the trees suddenly called
attention to itself by tweaking your ear! It is
such a surprise to feel in the silent woods the
sharp sting of a shot from a silent air gun. You
stand still, listening, and feeling of your ear.
It is a fine frosty October day, and still. As you
listen, another shot strikes the dead leaves at
your feet. Where do they come from? This
question you will probably not be able to answer
at once; but while you are looking in the bushes
from which the missile seemed to come, thinking
to rout some joker from his ambush, you discover
the blossoms of the witch hazel. Each one is
waving four little yellow petals, and among these
delicate blossoms the bullet pods are bunched.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Some of these are yawning wide open, each
showing two empty seed pockets, but you do not
find any seeds.</p>
<p>Cut a bundle of these things, and carry them
home. Put them in a vase of water. The delicate
fragrance of the flowers will go through the
house, and every one will marvel that any tree or
bush can be found in blossom at the very end of
the year. Now the strangest thing will happen.
Above the quiet talk around the evening lamp
sounds the sharp click, as of a bit of metal, or a
bead striking the wall with considerable force.
Every one sits up to listen. A second click, this
time on the glass covering a picture, is located,
and a little black object, smaller than an apple
seed, pointed and tipped with white, is picked
up from the floor. It is this seed which was
thrown against the glass; and it does not require
a Sherlock Holmes to prove that it came out of
one of the witch hazel seed pods. If each person
takes a twig, and keeps an eye upon the pods,
that show a slight opening, more than one of the
pods will be seen when they burst, and throw their
seeds. The warmth of the indoor air springs
the trigger, and the tiny projectiles fly.</p>
<p>How surprised the squirrels must be when the
witch hazel guns are bombarding the dry leaf
carpet of the woods! How much pleasure it
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
gives you to take your friends to the thicket, and
explain to them the meaning of those scattering
shots the pods are firing each crisp autumn day!
If it is rainy weather the pods will all be closed.
But let the sun come out, and dry them, and the
game begins again.</p>
<p>Can any one wonder that witch hazel trees
grow in companies? Each little tree flings its
seeds in all directions, and for each seed planted
a little tree may come. Twenty feet from the
parent tree the pods are able to throw their seeds.</p>
<p>Extract of witch hazel is obtained by boiling
twigs and leaves of this tree in a still with alcohol.
The Indians taught white men that this plant
contained a drug which had soothing and curative
powers when rubbed upon sprains and
bruises. Whether there is any truth in this notion
or not, the belief is still strong, and people
continue to rub extract of witch hazel on their
bruises, even though many doctors say there is
nothing medicinal in it but the alcohol.</p>

</div>
<p>In England the witch elm corresponds to our
own witch hazel. No one in the mining regions
would dare to sink a shaft for coal unless he had
warrant for doing so from the actions of a
divining rod in the hands of a competent person.
In other regions the digging of a well depends
upon the same thing, and this idea prevails in
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
many parts of this country. An old fellow who
can &ldquo;water witch&rdquo; may be found in most old-fashioned
communities. If you wish to dig a
well, you must call on him to locate the site. He
cuts a y-shaped twig from the witch hazel, trims
it, and is ready for the ceremony. Grasping one
of the two tips in each hand, and holding the
main stem erect, he paces over the ground you
have chosen. In his rigid hands the supple twigs
waver, and finally the wand bends downward.
This, according to popular belief, is the proper
place to find good water, and plenty of it. The
water witch moves away, again holding the stem
erect. He comes back finally, and as he crosses
the spot again, the wand goes down. Now every
one is sure that this is the spot, and the well is
dug. If the seer&rsquo;s prediction comes true, his
reputation improves, and scoffers concede that
&ldquo;there may be something in it, after all.&rdquo; In
regions where the witch hazel does not grow, a
twig of wild plum tree will do.</p>
<h3 id="c10">THE OAK FAMILY</h3>
<p>The fifty kinds of oak trees that are native
to America are about evenly divided on the two
sides of the Rocky Mountains. No Western
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
oaks are found in the Eastern states, and none
of our Eastern kinds grows wild on the other side
of the mountains. The backbone of the continent
is a bar that neither group has been able
to pass.</p>
<p>To know fifty different kinds of oaks by sight,
so as to call each one by its right name, is not
an easy task; and yet it is not so difficult as it
at first might seem. To begin with, any tree we
meet, which bears acorns, we at once recognise
as an oak. By this one sign, we are able to
set this great family apart from every other tree.
As soon as they are old enough, all oaks bear
acorns. If a tree which we suspect to be an oak
has no acorn to show us, on or under the tree,
a little close looking will usually find some acorn
cups still hanging on, or lying where they fell
upon the ground.</p>
<p>The leaves of oaks are distinctive. In general,
they are all simple, and their outline is oval.
The borders are variously cut by deep or shallow
bays, between sharp points or rounding finger-like
lobes. They are leathery in texture, compared
with leaves of most trees. After a little
practice, we learn to recognise oak leaves, no
matter how variously cut their borders may be.</p>
<p>In spring the flowers of oaks come out with
the leaves. A fringe of catkins at the base of
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the new shoot is composed of pollen-bearing
flowers. In the angles of the new leaves farther
up the stem, we shall find the little acorn flowers,
usually in twos. This is the flower arrangement
of all the oaks; staminate and pistillate flowers
on the new shoots, separate and very different
from each other, but always close together, and
always both kinds on each tree. The fringe of
catkins falls as soon as the pollen is shed. Little,
red, forked tongues are thrust out by the pistillate
flowers to catch the golden dust when it is
flying through the air, and thus to set seed. All
through the summer, the little acorns are growing.
We can find them in their tiny cups in the
angles of the leaves.</p>
<p>In the autumn the acorns are ripe, and falling.
Some trees will show acorns of two sizes, half-grown
ones on the new shoots, and full-sized
ones on the bare twigs, just back of the new
shoots.</p>
<p>This peculiarity divides the oak family into
two great groups. One group is composed of
trees which have light-coloured bark, bear a crop
every year, and in winter are bare of fruit. This
is known as the White Oak Group. Its leaves
have rounded margin lobes which do not end in
sharp points, as many of the lobes of oak leaves
do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>All of the oaks whose leaves have pointed,
spiny lobes on their margin belong to the Black
Oak Group. The bark of these trees is usually
dark-coloured. The acorns require two years of
growth. For this reason, there are half-grown
acorns on the tree all winter, waiting for the
second summer to bring them to maturity. Every
autumn the acorns which are ripe are found
on the twigs just back of the leafy shoots,
which grew during the past summer. These
acorns have completed their second year of
growth.</p>
<p>When we hear any one speak of annual-fruited
and biennial-fruited oaks, we know that the
White Oak and Black Oak Groups are meant.
If you see an oak tree whose leaves are cut into
sharp pointed lobes, you will find acorns of two
sizes on its twigs. If you look across the fence
and see a pale-barked oak with finger-lobed
leaves, and not a spiny point on their margins,
you will know that acorns of but one
size will be found. Fix these three points
in mind. Then study all the oak trees you
can find.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Trees of the White Oak Group have:</p>
<p class="t">1. Rounded lobes on their leaf margins.</p>
<p class="t">2. Acorns ripe in a single season.</p>
<p class="t">3. Pale-coloured bark.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Trees of the Black Oak Group have:</p>
<p class="t">1. Spiny-pointed lobes on their leaves.</p>
<p class="t">2. Acorns requiring two seasons to ripen.</p>
<p class="t">3. Dark-coloured bark</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c11">THE WHITE OAK</h3>
<p>Those who know trees best agree that there
is no nobler broad-leaved tree in the American
forests than the White Oak. Tree lovers in
England have but one native oak upon which
to spend their loyal devotion, the tree worship
inherited from Druid ancestors, whose temples
were their sacred groves of oaks. The same
feeling is in our blood, and roused at sight of
an aged white oak, with stout, buttressed trunk,
and great horizontal limbs supporting a rounded
dome, much broader than high.</p>
<p>The tree is grey in winter. It stands bare of
leaves, clothed in its pale, scaly bark. This is
the time to study the framework of the dome.
The limbs are twisted and gnarled, and their
branches end in dense thickets of twigs. Each
twig bears the winter buds, and five buds are
clustered at the tip of each.</p>
<p>In spring these buds open, and a leafy shoot
comes out of each. At the base are the yellow,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
fringed catkins of the sterile flowers, and above
them, in the angles between leaves and twig,
the fertile flowers thrust out forked tongues for
pollen. These will be acorns next autumn, if
the pollen falls upon them, and thus sets seed.</p>
<p>All summer the leaves are green, with pale
linings, and when summer ends, they turn to
rich shades of purplish red. The sweet acorns
are ripe, and as they fall, thrifty squirrels are
all about, gathering them into their hidden store-houses
for winter use. Plenty of the thin, shallow
cups we shall find, but the kernels are scarce,
unless we come when they are falling in October.</p>
<p>The Indians taught the early colonists in
America to use acorns of this species for food.
They boiled them, like hominy, and found them
not only nourishing, but good to eat.</p>
<p>If you find solitary white oaks growing here
and there in a mixed woods, you may wonder
how they were planted thus. The tree cannot
scatter its own seeds. It depends upon the work
of scampering nut-gatherers, in fur coats, that
put away more acorns than they can eat during
the long winter. An acorn that is left over in
one of the dark pockets along a squirrel&rsquo;s run-way
sprouts in the spring, and in a few years it
is a sturdy oak sapling. All oaks are dependent
on outside help in planting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>White oak lumber is very high-priced. The
wood of this tree we rarely see nowadays except
in the most expensive oak furniture. The beautiful
satiny streaks that are the chief ornament of
the grain in polished table tops, are bands of fibres
that radiate from the central pith to the bark.
When oak is &ldquo;quarter-sawed,&rdquo; these <i>pith rays</i>,
called &ldquo;mirrors,&rdquo; show to best advantage. They
are most numerous in the wood of the white oak.</p>
<h3 id="c12">THE BUR OR MOSSY-CUP OAK</h3>
<p>The largest acorn I know is the fruit of the
bur oak, and it is borne in a mossy cup, indeed.
The cup&rsquo;s scales are drawn out into long, hairy
points, and those near the rim form a loose
fringe. Once in a while you may find an acorn
almost covered up in its husk. But as a rule,
the nut is a little more than half-covered. Sometimes
these nuts are two inches long, but this
is not usual. They are over an inch long, and
almost as broad, and the meat is white and sweet.
No wonder squirrels harvest the crop, and young
trees spring up wherever an acorn is missed by the
hungry creatures.</p>
<p>The bur oak is a shaggy tree, for it sheds its
bark in big flakes, like the sycamore. The small
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
branches are stout, and their bark is developed
into corky wings, like the sweet gum. The tree
is irregular in shape, too, its gnarled limbs are
thrown out in any direction, and so the top is
often unsymmetrical. But it is a rugged and
picturesque tree, in spite of all its faults, and it
adds beauty of an unusual kind to parks and
woodlands.</p>
<p>In Sioux City, Iowa, an aged bur oak stands
in Riverside Park. It is called &ldquo;The Council
Oak,&rdquo; for it was a venerable tree in the days
when the Indians lived on the banks of the
Missouri River. Under this tree their chieftains
used to meet the white men, and talk over the
questions that interested both. Here treaties
were drawn up and signed that kept peace between
the red and white men.</p>
<p>I promise a great deal of pleasure to any one
who plants a mossy-cup acorn. The seedling
tree is wonderfully vigorous in growth. The
leaves are often a foot long in the first years of
the tree&rsquo;s life. The blades are thick, lustrous
above, and woolly lined, the finger lobes irregular,
and two opposite, deep sinuses near the
middle of the leaf cut it almost in two!</p>
<p>Before the tree is more than a sapling it
blossoms and bears big acorns in their handsome
mossy cups. There is no stage in the life of
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
one of these oaks that is not beautiful and interesting.</p>
<p>This tree is found from Nova Scotia to Western
Texas. It forms forests in Winnipeg, and
&ldquo;oak openings&rdquo; in Minnesota and Dakota. It
is as much at home in the hot, arid stretches of
the plains of the West and Southwest as in the
raw, damp air of the New England coasts. In
the rich valley of the Ohio River it reached
nearly two hundred feet in height in the virgin
forests.</p>
<p>Unlike many oaks, it may be safely transplanted
while young.</p>
<h3 id="c13">THE LIVE OAK</h3>
<p>The citizen of New Orleans takes his Northern
visitors to Audubon Park, and points with pride
to the giant live oak trees. He does not hesitate,
for he knows that the noble pair called &ldquo;George
Washington,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Martha Washington,&rdquo;
though crippled now by tornadoes, are more noted
the country over than any monument or building
in this famous old city. In Charleston and other
Southern cities it is the same. Famous old live
oaks adorn the parks and avenues, and the same
trees are planted year by year to take the places
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of the veterans when age and storms shall make
an end of their long lives.</p>
<p>These trees wear a crown of green throughout
the year. The leaves last but one year, but they
cling to the twigs and remain green until they
are gradually pushed off by the opening of new
leafy shoots. In spring the new leaves are much
brighter than the darker old ones. Everywhere
the trees are draped with the sage-green ropes
of &ldquo;Spanish moss,&rdquo; which is not a moss at all,
but a flowering plant that steals its living by
lodging its roots in crevices in the bark of trees.</p>
<p>The live oak acorns are dainty, dark-brown
nuts, set in hoary, long-stemmed cups. Each
year there is a good crop of acorns, and they are
sweet, and pleasant to the taste. The Indians
depended upon them for food, roasting or boiling
them. They also skimmed the boiling pot to
collect the oil, which the early colonists said was
much like oil of almonds.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;knees of oak&rdquo; that early ship-builders
used to brace the sides of vessels, were taken
from live oak trees, where the great boughs
spring out from the short, stout trunks. This
natural joint is better than any bolted union of
two pieces of timber. The scarcity of these trees
makes it impossible now to supply these knees,
but no steel frame serves the purpose quite so
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
well. The wood is as beautiful as white oak
for the making of handsome furniture, though it
splits more easily, and is harder for the cabinet-maker
to use.</p>
<p>The tree grows throughout the South to Texas;
also in Mexico, and Lower California. Its
Northern limit is Virginia.</p>
<p>A friend who has for a near neighbour the
majestic McDonough Oak, patriarch among the
noble live oaks of the Audubon Park, New
Orleans, writes interestingly of the habits of this
species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The live oak sheds its leaves <i>in the spring</i>,
just before the new leaves open. So, for a brief
time the tree stands leafless. In this period, however,
the tree puts out catkins in great abundance,
so that the tree does not appear bare. These
catkins are light brown, and have a soft, velvety
appearance, and a tree has an absolute change of
colour. During this blossom time the splendid
form of the trunk and the great limbs is revealed.
When the new leaves appear, the framework of
branch and bough is concealed by leafage so
dense as to be impenetrable to sun or eye. The
tree is a symmetrical, shining green dome. The
crown of the McDonough oak is over two hundred
feet in diameter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h3 id="c14">THE POST OAK</h3>
<p>The post oak, a small, rugged tree, is noticeable
in winter, because its leaves usually hang on until
the open buds in spring push them off. The
colour of this winter foliage is yellowish brown,
and not at all striking nor beautiful. The bark
is brown and deeply furrowed. The twigs wear
a yellow fuzz. The leaves are coarse, stiff and
rough, four to five inches long, tapering from
three broad, squarish lobes to a narrow base, and
a short leaf stalk. They are lined with brownish
wool, and are dark green and shining above in
summer.</p>
<p>The acorns of the post oak are borne in a
plentiful annual crop. Each is dainty and trim,
in a shallow cup of loose, blunt-pointed scales.
The kernel is sweet. In the days when wild
game roamed the woods, wild turkeys fattened
on these acorns, and some people call the tree
the &ldquo;turkey oak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another name for this tree is &ldquo;iron oak,&rdquo; for
its wood is hard, and heavy, and close-grained.
It makes admirable posts and railroad ties, because
it does not rot in contact with water. It
is used in boat-building, and for barrel staves.
&ldquo;Knees&rdquo; of post oak (the angles between trunk
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and branch) form most admirable timbers to be
used in the framework of boats.</p>
<h3 id="c15">THE SWAMP WHITE OAK</h3>
<p>The swamp white oak is a rugged and ragged
tree, with drooping branches and crooked twigs,
covered with greyish brown bark which peels in
thin flakes from branches and trunk. This habit
of shedding its bark in irregular plates reminds
us strongly of the sycamore, which carries this
habit to excess. The leaves of this oak are
large, wedge-shaped at the base, wavy-toothed
or lobed, and broadening towards the tips. They
are dark green above, and lined with white down.
The acorns are borne in pairs on long stems.
The oval nut is hairy at its tip, and sits in a
rough cup made of scales, sometimes fringed at
the border. The kernel is sweet and eatable, not
only for beasts, but for man. If one were lost
in the woods, he need not starve nor die of
thirst, if he is near a stream, and can get the
fruit of a swamp white oak, which stands by the
water side. He will do well to make a fire, and
roast the acorns, which will improve their nutty
flavour, and make them more digestible.</p>
<p>This white oak is more beautiful in May than
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
at any other season of the year. The young
leaves are pale green, and the tree top is illuminated
by the silky hairs that line them. The
whiteness of the down is dimmed as summer
advances. In the autumn the leaves turn yellow,
but never red.</p>
<p>The wood of this oak is not distinguished in
the lumber trade from any other white oak.
The demand for it for the building of houses
and boats, and for agricultural implements and
vehicles, is greater than the supply. It is too
expensive now to be used as it was a few years
ago, for fuel, railroad ties, and fence posts.</p>
<h3 id="c16">THE CHESTNUT OAK</h3>
<p>The chestnut oak has leaves which are much
like those of the chestnut tree. They are larger,
and wider, however, and have rounded lobes at
the ends of the side veins, making a very regular
wavy margin, compared with that of most oak
leaves. The lining is often silky, and always
much paler than the upper surface. This tree
is an exception to the rule that the annual-fruited
oaks have pale bark. This one has bark so dark
in colour that it is often mistaken for one of
the Black Oak Group, although its wavy leaf
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
margins, and its annual crop of acorns, prove
it to belong to the White Oak Group.</p>
<p>The acorns are very long, and smooth, and
they sit in thin cups lined with down, and covered
with small swollen scales. They are usually
borne alone on short stems. This is one of
the largest and sweetest acorns. The squirrels
pack them among their winter&rsquo;s stores.</p>
<p>The wood of chestnut oak is hard, and strong,
and durable in contact with the soil. The bark
is especially rich in tannic acid. For this
reason many of the finest trees yield only
tan bark, because the peelers take the bark,
and leave the log to fall a prey to forest
fires.</p>
<h3 id="c17">THE BLACK OAK</h3>
<p>The black oak, which gives its name to the
large group of biennial-fruited oaks, is one of
our handsome, sturdy forest trees. It grows
from Maine to Florida, and west to Minnesota,
Kansas, and Eastern Texas. Its bark is very
dark grey or brown, and thick, with rough,
broken ridges and deep furrows. Under this
outer layer is a yellow belt, rich in tannin. This
gives the tree the name &ldquo;yellow oak,&rdquo; and since
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
its bark is valuable in tanning leather, it is some
times called the &ldquo;tan bark oak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tree is not graceful nor symmetrical, but
there is a picturesqueness and strength about it
that redeems its coarseness and irregularity.
This species would be planted oftener for shade,
were there not so many beautiful oaks to choose
from. In the wild, however, a giant black oak
is a noble feature of the landscape.</p>
<p>In early spring the large downy winter buds
begin to swell, and soon the leaves push rapidly
out. The whole tree top flushes crimson in the
sunshine. The red glow is from the crinkly,
half-awake baby leaves, whose brilliance is softened
by a silky covering of white hairs. In a
day the leaves turn green, and most of their silky
covering is shed.</p>
<p>The bloom of the black oak consists of a fringe
of yellow catkins at the base of each shoot, and
pairs of red-tongued acorn flowers in the angles
of some of the leaves. Back of the new shoot
the half-grown acorns of the previous season
are seen. In autumn the new crop is well along
and the full-grown acorns, which have taken two
seasons to ripen, are ready to be shed. Each
kernel sits in a straight-sided cup of loosely
shingled scales, which form a fringe at the margin.
The kernel is bitter, and yellow, as it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
in most of the species of the Black Oak Group.</p>

</div>
<p>The large, downy, pointed buds of this oak
will often determine its name for us when we
are confused by the shapes of the leaves. Often
the red oak and the black oak &ldquo;run together&rdquo;
in their leaf forms. To determine the tree&rsquo;s
name we must call in the buds, the acorns, and
their cups, and the general shape of the trees,
and consider all these points together.</p>
<p>Black oak leaves are thick, coarse, and leathery.
Crumple one in your hand, and you cringe at
the harsh scratching noise it makes. They vary
from four to ten inches in length, and from two
to six inches in breadth. The margins are deeply
cut into seven or nine broad, bristly-toothed lobes,
with rounded bays between. The upper surface
is dark green in summer, shining and smooth, or
sometimes hairy. The lining is brownish and
a remnant of the scurfy down is found in the
neighbourhood of the veins. In autumn these
leaves turn brownish-yellow, but rarely show a
tinge of red.</p>
<p>The bark of black oak is stripped and carried
to the tan-yards. Or it furnishes a yellow dye,
used in the printing of calicoes. The wood is
used in house-building, and in the manufacture
of furniture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h3 id="c18">THE RED OAK</h3>
<p>The red oak is the tree most likely to be mistaken
for the black oak. The bark is brown,
with a decided red tinge. The twigs are also
reddish, and the wood is red-brown. The inner
bark has the same tinge instead of the orange-coloured
lining the black oak bark has.</p>
<p>The red oak is a large, stately tree, sometimes
150 feet in height, and far more symmetrical
than the black oak. Its leaves vary greatly in
the depth of their marginal clefts, but in general
they are oval in outline, and their lobes and
sinuses are triangular. These lobes always
point forward, rather than outward, along the
sides of the leaf, and they always end in the
sharp, spiny points that belong to the leaves of
all the trees that fall into the Black Oak Group.
Red oak leaves are thinner than those of black
oak, and not so harsh when crumpled in the
hand. Their linings are pale green and smooth
in summer. Their autumn colour is deep red.</p>
<p>The buds of the red oak are pointed, smooth,
reddish, and about one-fourth of an inch long.
They are much smaller, and lack the down of
the buds of the black oak.</p>
<p>Red oak acorns are the most distinct feature
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
of this species. They are large, often over an
inch in length, and broad, and they sit in saucers,
instead of cups. These saucers are made of
close scales, and they curl in closely at the top
as if to tighten their hold on the nut, which extends
two-thirds its height above this rim. The
kernel is white, and extremely bitter.</p>
<h3 id="c19">THE SCARLET OAK</h3>
<p>The scarlet oak need not be confused with
either the red or black oaks, for it is a far more
dainty tree than either in its trim trunk, graceful
curving branches, very slim twigs, and deeply
cut leaves. In form, these leaves are oval, but
so much of the &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; is cut away by the four
or six deep bays along the sides that a small
amount of green is left to do leaf duty. The
slender lobes are strengthened by the branching
veins, each of which ends in a spiny point. These
almost skeleton leaves are beautifully lustrous
and thin, a trifle paler beneath and sometimes
hairy tufted at the veins. They are rarely six
inches long, and the side lobes sometimes measure
five inches from tip to tip. The leaf stems are
long and flexible, and the whole tree top is as
light and feathery and tremulous in a breeze
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
as that of a honey locust or a willow. In autumn
the scarlet oak blazes like a torch above the duller
reds and browns of the woods, and keeps its
brilliancy later than any other oak.</p>
<p>The acorn differs from the black oak in being
smaller and daintier, and in having its cup drawn
in tightly at the rim. The scales are smooth and
close-pressed; the kernel white and bitter.</p>
<h3 id="c20">THE PIN OAK</h3>
<p>The pin oak has foliage much like the scarlet
oak, but coarser and not so lustrous. Often a
pin oak tree has leaves that approach the red
oak in form, and these lead to confusion, if
leaves alone are consulted in determining the
name of the tree. There are better signs in
any pin oak that set it apart from its larger-leaved
relative. Consult the acorns. They are
plump little nuts, as broad as long, rarely measuring
one-half inch either way, pale brown,
streaked with black in straight lines, down from
the pointed tips, and they sit in shallow, saucer-like
cups made of close reddish scales. As they
fall, the nuts roll out of the cups, which are
lined with hair. The kernel is white and bitter
and yet, late in winter, it is very common to
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
find them gnawed open by some hungry little
four-foot, whose winter store threatens to run
short.</p>
<p>The pin oak takes its name from the fact that
its branches are thickly set with short, pin-like
twigs, many of which die but do not fall. These
stubs stay on for several years. This fact alone
will soon enable us to recognise the tree from
a distance. No other species is so close-twigged,
and the symmetrical form of this tree is very
striking in the winter. It is a pyramid with many
small branches thrust out horizontally from the
main shaft. Below the middle of the tree, the
long branches have a downward thrust, and the
lowest ones often sweep the ground. Above the
middle of the tree the branches are horizontal,
and they gradually become shorter, and the tree
ends in a pointed tip. There is no oak that I
know which has so much the pyramidal form
of evergreens like the firs, hemlocks, and spruces.</p>
<p>On the avenues of the city of Washington, we
shall find superb double rows of American trees.
On one which leads to the Navy Yard, I remember
the beautiful pin oaks, uniform in size,
perfect in symmetry, that stood in a double row
along the sides of the avenue. To the crowds
of tourists who visit the capital city every year,
I hope that this will be an object lesson. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
most towns and cities every owner plants the
trees he likes in front of his house, so our streets
and avenues present a mixture of trees of all
ages, sizes, kinds, and conditions. The better
way is for the city to plant the same tree in
double lines, the whole length of a street, as
has of late years been done in Washington. One
needs only to see these trees coming on, each
year adding beauty and dignity to the city, to
realise that such planting may be done easily anywhere
in the country, where trees as beautiful
as the pin oaks grow wild.</p>
<h3 id="c21">THE WILLOW OAK</h3>
<p>A Southern tree with slender twigs and narrow
leaves like those of a willow, surprises us
by bearing acorns! It is the willow oak, a beautiful,
graceful tree for shade and for avenue
planting. The tree naturally chooses wet ground,
but it thrives where the soil is deep and well
drained. I remember a fine large willow oak
in John Bartram&rsquo;s garden in Philadelphia, and
a young tree in the Arnold Arboretum in Boston.
This little one grows rapidly, but the frost nips
its twigs in the winter. The species grows wild
from New York southward, just back from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
sea coast, to Texas. In swampy land, it is found
from Missouri southward.</p>
<p>Willow oak acorns are downy, yellow-brown,
and set in shallow saucer-shaped cups. The kernel
is orange-yellow, and bitter. Half-grown
acorns are found with the ripe ones on these
trees, and the dark, rough bark agrees with others
of the Black Oak Group. Though the leaves
have rarely a side lobe, but are mostly narrow
and plain-margined, the tip ends in a spine, as
all black oak leaves should.</p>
<h3 id="c22">TREES WITH WINGED SEEDS</h3>
<p>Why do the trees grow in such mixed groves,
when Nature does the planting? Here and there
we find solid groves of beech or oak, but the
forest is, for the most part, a gathering together
of all kinds of trees. A part of the beauty
of any woodland is this variety in the planting.
Under a tall oak we find a hornbeam, and under
this the witch hazel, and under the witch hazel,
a carpet of low woodland plants. We may walk
in a straight line, or follow a woodland path
a mile, and find every tree we meet is different
from all the rest.</p>
<p>Many reasons explain the order in which Nature
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
plants forests. One of the best of these
is found in the kind of seeds trees bear. We
shall find that trees most widely scattered are
those whose seeds are winged. It is not hard
to find, from May until far past midwinter, trees
bearing light, winged seeds. All through the
summer, the wind is busy sowing the seeds of
the early-fruiting trees. In autumn, and all
through the winter, the sowing of the larger
crop goes on.</p>
<p>Let us begin our study with the maples,
whose winged seeds every child knows. From
the silver maple, whose seeds are dry before the
first of June, there is a procession of ripening
maple seeds that lasts throughout the year. A
high wind shakes off the silver maple&rsquo;s keys in
showers in late May. Watch those in the tree-tops.
The wind has a better chance up there.
Each key, loosening from its twig, turns round
and round in a dizzy whirl, and sails away still
whirling as it falls, the heavy seed end always
pointed downward. A tree is soon stripped,
and the ground littered under it. But a great
deal larger area than the tree&rsquo;s shadow has the
seeds scattered over it: the stronger the wind,
the further these seeds go. Before the summer
is over, a crop of little maple trees springs up
from this sowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>The red maple&rsquo;s scarlet seed clusters turn
brown, and the little winged seeds take flight in
June. Lighter and smaller, they are carried
longer distances than the seeds of the silver
maple, and a crop of little red maples follows
this June sowing of the trees.</p>
<p>I remember walking in a corn field in late
June; the corn had been last ploughed a month
before. Among the weeds that had grown up
in this short time was a crop of young red maples,
now six inches high. It was amazing to see
these little trees grow so plentifully in a cultivated
field. I looked for the seed tree, and
there it stood on the edge of the field, the only
maple tree in sight. A few young trees were
growing in the matted grass of the roadside under
the tree, but the great crop was from the
seeds that flew out to the mellow ground between
the corn rows. The disappointed seeds, those
which fell and did not grow, were under the
tree and in the dusty road.</p>
<p>In the autumn the hard maple, which we call
the sugar maple, ripens its winged seeds. So
does the three-leaved box elder (which is a
maple) and the Norway maple, now a very familiar
street tree. The wind takes its time, and
the trees stubbornly hang on to their seeds, so
that these maples are busy all winter with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
sowing. Every day they give up a few, and
many seeds that fall on the snow are picked up,
again and again, by the wind and thus carried
further and further away.</p>
<p>The maple seed, with its curiously one-sided
wing, is the sign by which the maple family is
easily recognised. Other trees have winged
seeds, but none have the peculiar form of this
one.</p>
<p>All summer long we may know the trees that
belong to the ash family by the clusters of pale
green darts that hang among their leaves. These
are the ash seeds. Each one is a pointed seed
case, containing the embryo plant, and out behind
it extends the thin, light, two-edged wing.
There is no one-sidedness to this blade. The seed
is winged, but balanced like a dart. When the
wind loosens one from the wiry stem, it goes
like an arrow, seed downward. If there is a
gale blowing, the seed may be caught up and
borne far away in the upper air, before a lull
lets it take a downward course, and drive its
point into a snowbank, or into the ground. This
little feathered arrow may be long or short, depending
upon whether it belongs to the red ash,
the white ash, or the black; but there is no mistaking
an ash tree for any other, once the form
of an ash seed is fixed in the mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>I have said that a maple seed is shaped like
that of no other tree. I must describe here
the seeds of the needle-leaved evergreens, which,
though very much smaller, are somewhat like
maple seeds in form. Go to a pine tree or a
spruce, and get one of the cones that has begun
to spread its scales apart. Shake the cone over
a piece of paper. If nothing comes out from
between the scales, cut or break the cone open
with knife or hatchet. Under each scale will
be found two seeds, each with a thin, one-sided
wing. Spruces, hemlocks, firs, and arbor vit&aelig;s,
all have this same type of seed, hid away in the
same fashion, under the protecting scales of their
cones. Do you understand how the wind, blowing
through the tops of evergreens, shakes the
winged seeds from their places, and carries them
far away? Do you understand why the ripe
cones of these trees hang on so stubbornly, and
spread their scales to allow the seeds to escape?</p>
<p>It is a peculiarity of the firs that they hold
their cones erect. It would seem hard for the
wind to get at the seeds, but the fir cones let
their scales fall, and when they loosen, the seeds
are freed.</p>
<p>Out of the balls of the sweet gum tree, which
dangle on the twigs all winter, the wind shakes
little winged seeds, not unlike those of the pines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Do you know the catalpa&rsquo;s long, green pods
that hang all summer on the top of trees? They
are longer than the newest lead pencil, and show
no signs of splitting, until the autumn. Now,
the two halves of the pod spread apart, and
gradually the thin seeds shake out. Each one
is in the centre of a thin, fringed wing, that
looks as if made of tissue paper. The wind
can carry these ghostly seeds for miles. Indeed,
it is strange that they ever come to the ground,
for they seem to have no thickness nor weight
at all.</p>
<p>The birches all bear their seeds in cones, some
long and pencil-like, others quite the shape of
a pine cone. Under each quaintly notched scale
of the cone, a seed is borne; and each heart-shaped
seed has a thin rim, which acts like a
wing, catching the wind as the seed falls. We
shall look far in the woods before we find seeds
daintier in form, or better sailors through the
air, than those of all the birch family.</p>
<p>The hop hornbeam has a hop-like cluster of
seeds, each in an inflated papery bag. When
the leaves drop in the fall, the wind has a chance
to pick off these little paper seed balloons, one
at a time, from the clusters. Take off one of
these little bags, open it, and you will find, set
in the bottom, the shiny, pointed seed. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
likely to have a long journey, if there be a good
breeze, before its bag is punctured.</p>
<p>Back to early May again, when the elm trees
are green with their fruit clusters, before the
leaves are fully out. Elm trees grow scattered
through the woods, and no wonder: the seeds
have papery rims, and the wind catches these
little falling discs, and scatters them far from
the tree where they were born.</p>
<p>The ailanthus tree, whose long, fern-like leaves
make it look like a tree from the Tropics, is
sowing its seeds all winter, with the help of the
wind. Examine one. In the middle of a slim
blade is the little seed. The blade is twisted
as it ripens, and it sails through the air with
a tilting, uncertain flight. After a look at a
bunch of these seeds, and after throwing a handful
of them out of an upper window, and watching
them as they sail away, we shall understand
how it is that ailanthus trees spring up in most
unexpected places, year after year. And we
shall bless the breeze that plants such trees along
the hot pavements, and in the ugly back alleys of
towns and cities, where few trees are able to
grow at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h3 id="c23">TREE SEEDS THAT HAVE PARACHUTES</h3>
<p>It is a thrilling moment when the man who
goes up with the balloon lets go at last, and
drops to the ground. Before he drops, an umbrella-like
parachute opens, and by its aid, he
comes to the ground gracefully, slowly, and
alights unhurt. Should anything go wrong with
his parachute he would drop to his death, so every
onlooker is anxious as he comes down, and
breathes a sigh of relief when the wonderful
feat is accomplished.</p>
<p>Seeds with wings sail away on the wind, and
seeds with parachutes descend so slowly and
gracefully that the winds carry them far out of
their courses. The trees most fortunate in scattering
their seeds, and thus colonising new territory,
have peculiar devices.</p>
<p>The seeds of the basswood hang in clusters
attached to a narrow, leaf-like blade. This is
a parachute, by which the whole cluster is able
to sail away on a good breeze. There is no seed
parachute like this among our forest trees. By
this sign alone we may know the basswood trees.</p>
<p>The balls of the sycamore bump against the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
branches, and tiny seeds with hairy parachutes
are loosened and scattered. Each is a minute
spike, which might drop to the ground, but for
the umbrella-like parachute made of a brush of
fine hairs. By this, the wind lifts the seed, and
carries it away.</p>
<p>Willow seeds, and those of the poplar, are
almost too small to be seen. Each seed is hid
in a dainty fluff of white cotton, and in this the
seed rides. We may miss seeing these trees
in fruit, unless we look at the down which accumulates
in June on the screens of windows
and doors. The air is full of the fluffy stuff
when the pods open. In a few days this harvest
is over, and we may find the empty pods on the
ground under our neighbour poplars, cottonwoods,
and willows.</p>
<p>The blue beech, or hornbeam, has a parachute
which is leafy, and crinkled so as to look almost
like a little boat. The shiny seed sits in one
end, and when it gets free, it has a fine long sail
through the air before it settles to the earth.</p>
<p>There are wings and parachutes on the seeds
of other trees. When you find them you may
know that the wind is the partner of the tree,
by robbing it of its children. The wind is saving
those children from death, which would have
been their fate, if they fell on the ground under
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the shadow of the parent tree. If all the fields
that adjoin the woods were left uncultivated for
a few years they would grow up to forests. We
know the name of the sower, who gathers seeds
in the woods, and plants them; who is busy all
the year at the endless work of the harvest and
the sowing.</p>
<h3 id="c24">THE AUTUMN BERRIES IN THE WOODS</h3>
<p>In the roadside thickets, as the summer
wanes, the berry clusters of the shrubby viburnums
turn red, and soften, and in September
change to a vivid, or a dark blue. They are
very pretty on their coral red stems, and look
like little plums. Indeed, they are not unpleasant
to taste, but it is the birds who delight in
these sweetish, juicy berries, and we are willing
that they should have them all. The names,
sheepberry and nannyberry, are given to these
little trees, because sheep are said to browse on
the foliage and shoots in spring.</p>
<p>The blue berries of the sassafras, also on coral
red stems, are not unlike those of the viburnums
in appearance, but fewer in a cluster. The birds
take them eagerly before they are fully ripe.
To leave them until they ripen would be to lose
them to other birds.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The dogwood berries are redder than the
whorl of leaves that surround the fruit clusters
in early October. These waxy berries have
taken the place of the central cluster of small
flowers, which were surrounded in spring by the
four large, white bracts.</p>
<p>It is the birds who first accept the invitation
of these little trees. The migrating hosts turn
southward in September, and in October the bird
procession is in full swing. We hear them overhead,
often so high in air that we cannot see
them. Tired of the long flight, they descend for
food and water, and if the neighbourhood has
many fruiting dogwood trees, the joy of the
winged voyagers is correspondingly great. In
a surprisingly short time the hungry birds have
taken the last one.</p>
<p>Far in the winter we shall find red berries
glowing in clusters on the mountain ash trees,
among the evergreen holly leaves, and in conical
spikes on the sumachs. The winter birds ignore
these dry, insipid seeds, until everything else is
gone. Frequently, when winter snows cover up
all other foods, the berries of these two trees
stand between the birds and actual starvation.
So it happens that many a mountain ash is
stripped of its fruit during the early days of
March, and the holly berries which have glowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
red all winter disappear for the same reason.
The sumachs are rarely stripped as closely as
the other two.</p>
<p>In September the hackberry hangs full of its
sugary fruits. It is surprising to find a tree
which looks like an elm, yet bearing soft, purple
berries. But this, we shall learn, is the hackberry&rsquo;s
way. Under each leaf a long thread grows,
on the end of which is a single, oblong berry, the
size of a pea, but not the same shape. The
fruit hangs on late into the winter, if the birds
will permit such a thing, and it is a grateful
supply of food to birds that winter in the North.
If there were no other reason for planting hackberry
trees, they are worth having as fruit trees
for the refreshment of birds.</p>
<p>The autumn colour of hackberry leaves is yellow.
The purple fruits make little show, until
the leaves fall. The bark of the tree is its chief
peculiarity. On the trunk it is deeply checked
into small, thick, warty plates. The branches
are often ridged and broken into warty excrescences
that stand close together.</p>
<p>The leaves are peculiar. There is no other
tree that has not a main vein, or a rib, which
prolongs the leaf stem straight to the tip. The
hackberry leaf stem divides into three equal
branches at the base. The two side branches are
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
shorter than the middle one, but their size is
unusual.</p>
<p>It is in autumn, of course, that the hackberry
earns its name, sugarberry. The bark will guide
us to the tree at any season. The leaves fix in
mind another important family trait. The berries
we may safely taste to find out if they are
as sugary as we are led to expect.</p>
<p>Nettle tree is the common name of the European
hackberry. You may have read of the
lotus-eaters, who, tasting the sweet fruit of this
little tree, straightway forgot their native land,
and could not be persuaded to return. The wood
is tough and peculiarly adapted to make the
handles of hayforks, and similar agricultural
implements. Young trees are grown for these
uses. The roots remain alive and send up suckers,
slender but tall. These are cut for walking
sticks, whipstocks, and ramrods for guns. Older
trees furnish wood, as hard as box or holly, and
beautiful as satinwood when polished. This is a
material which the wood-carvers delight to use.
The tree is widely planted for shade, and its
leaves are used as fodder for cattle.</p>
<p>Bad as its reputation is, according to the tradition
that its fruit had power to rob men of
their patriotism, yet this is one of the most useful
little trees. It grows easily, and is contented
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
on land that is worthless for other purposes.</p>
<p>Besides the hackberry, another big tree in our
woods bears a crop of purple berries in September.
That is the wild black cherry. The bark
of this tree is dark brown and shining, and satiny
smooth on the branches. It breaks on the trunk
into rough, squarish plates, which curl horizontally
at the edges. The plates still retain the
silky outer bark, whose fibres run crosswise, and
whose surface has many slit-like, horizontal
breathing holes.</p>
<p>We are strongly reminded of the birches, especially
the cherry birch, which has dark-coloured
bark, and has its name from its resemblance to
this tree. The thin young bark of the black
cherry curls in a very birch-like fashion. One
difference is very marked. The bark of the
cherry is bitter, with the flavour of the pit of
a peach or cherry. Birch bark is pleasantly
aromatic in flavour.</p>
<p>The fruit of the black cherry is more plentiful
than that of the hackberry. The close-set side
shoots on the new twigs end in fruit clusters
two or three inches long, and often containing
a dozen berries each. The sweet pulp is flavoured
with the bitter taste of cherry pits, a flavour
found in the sap of this tree. Nibble the bark,
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
or a bit of cherry wood, a leaf, or the tip of
the root, and you get the same Prussic acid
taste.</p>
<p>I do not like wild black cherries, but many
people do. Children and birds seem not to notice
the bitter with the sweet. They eat the berries
as soon as they change colour, with evident enjoyment.</p>
<p>Cherry brandies and cordials are made from
the fruit by people who rely upon old-fashioned
home remedies. These are the people who chew
the bitter opening buds of the wild cherry in
spring, as they drink sassafras tea, believing that
spring is the time to clear the blood, and that
Nature offers free remedies far better than they
can buy in bottles.</p>
<p>We cannot wonder that wild cherry trees
spring up in the woods, in fence corners, and
along roadsides. The birds are feasting in the
trees each autumn, and until the last berry is
taken. They are the sowers of the seed.</p>
<p>Our greatest objection to the wild cherry is
the fact that its shining young leaves are regarded
by the apple tree tent caterpillars as particularly
good. When the white blossom clusters
deck this tree in May, we often see a web of
white silk wrapping together some of the upper
branches. Day by day the web is extended,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and the twigs are stripped of their leaves by the
host of caterpillars which return at night to the
tent, and range more widely in the day time.
When the tent is as large as a peach basket, it
is found empty, for the caterpillars have descended
to the ground, spun their cocoons, and
will soon emerge as winged moths, to lay their
eggs, from which later broods of caterpillars
come. The winged females are very likely to
seek the nearest orchard, and lay their eggs in
bands around apple twigs. Many an otherwise
harmless roadside wild cherry is a deadly menace
to an orchard because it breeds the insects, which,
in a second generation, become a serious pest
among the apple trees.</p>
<p>In the forest the lumberman is glad to find
wild black cherry trees of large size. The lumber
is very valuable for interior finish of houses,
and for furniture. It is hard, and close-grained,
and dark reddish-brown in colour, with a lustre,
when polished, that puts it in the class with mahogany
and rosewood. It is more often used
nowadays as a veneer on cheaper woods. Parlour
cars and steamships, and fine houses are very
often finished in cherry. The small limbs and
other bits of the lumber are utilised for tool
handles and for inlay work. The wood is too
valuable to waste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The largest berry that grows on a tree in
the woods of the United States is the persimmon.
We should mistake this berry for an apple,
perhaps, when we see it for the first time&mdash;a
little, orange-brown apple, one to two inches in
diameter. But there is no core such as apples
have, though there are from one to a dozen seeds
in each fruit.</p>
<p>The persimmon tree is tall, with a handsome
round head, and zig-zag, twisted branches. It
grows from Rhode Island west to Kansas and
south to Florida and Texas. It is found scattered
in mixed woods, and comes up in fence
rows and in abandoned fields wherever the seeds
have been dropped. Light, sandy soil is this
tree&rsquo;s preference. Although it is a relative of
the ebony of Ceylon, our persimmon is not an
important lumber tree. Its wood is hard, dark-brown
in colour, and is used for shoe lasts, tool
handles, and various other small articles.</p>
<p>In the South the persimmon ranks among the
choicest of fruit trees. The negro and the
possum await the ripening of the &rsquo;simmons with
eager eyes, and the Southerner, born and bred,
confesses an equal interest in this native fruit.
There is a long waiting period between the time
when the persimmons change colour from green
to reddish-yellow and the time when the frost
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
mellows and sweetens the pulp, and takes away
the harsh, puckery taste which draws the lips
and chokes the throat as if the fruit were a lump
of alum. The Northerner who judges by its
appearance only, dares to taste this fruit before
it is ripe. He cannot be persuaded to try it
again. And he cannot understand the enthusiasm
for persimmons that all people in the South
feel.</p>
<p>A &rsquo;simmon tree, when the fruit is ripe, belongs
to the first comer. The negro and the opossum
come into direct competition for the fruit
of this tree. You might think the negro would
kill the opossum, and be rid of his rival. He
knows too much for that. &ldquo;&rsquo;Possum an&rsquo; &rsquo;simmons
come together, and bofe is good fruit.&rdquo;
Better divide the &rsquo;simmons with the &rsquo;possum and
his family. Then get the fat &rsquo;possum for the
Christmas dinner. There is no &rsquo;possum like the
one that is fattened on persimmons, so it pays
to be patient and leave the beast his share of the
fruit.</p>
<p>In a hollow tree, or a woodpile, the opossums
sleep by day, and trail out in companies to climb
the persimmon trees at night to feast. They
hang by their tails on the branches, or prop themselves
in crotches of the limbs within easy reach
of the soft, sugary berries. The fatter they get,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the lazier they are; and as the season advances,
and the fruit falls, the opossums are likely to
satisfy their appetites with the persimmons they
can pick up under the trees. Along about
Thanksgiving day, or Christmas, the day of reckoning
arrives, when the negro hunter comes home
with the opossums which have stolen his persimmons.
The whole score is wiped out by
the opossum feast, which suitably closes the
season.</p>
<p>Persimmons improve, the longer they hang
upon the trees. As late as January or February,
little trees scarcely a dozen feet high, which have
been overlooked in the &rsquo;simmon harvest, are
found to be still hung with fruits exceptionally
large and fine. To the hungry and thirsty hunter,
prowling for quail in the underbrush, these unexpected
fruits are a delightful surprise. They
are delicious, sugary lumps, rich in flavour, and
juicy, taking away both hunger and thirst, and
leaving no after-taste that is bitter or puckery,
suggesting their unripe stage.</p>
<p>Japanese persimmon trees, whose fruit is
larger and better in every respect than our native
species, have been successfully introduced into
California and the Southern states. These persimmons
look like great ripe tomatoes as we see
them on the fruit stands, but these, too, must wait
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
until they are thoroughly ripe before they are
fit to eat.</p>
<h3 id="c25">THE CHANGING COLOUR OF THE AUTUMN WOODS</h3>
<p>All through the autumn, when the wonderful
colours come in the forest leaves, we shall see
the green of these leaves creeping back along
the veins. The horse chestnut leaves tell a very
interesting story. They turn brown first upon
the edges. If we watch a single leaf for a whole
week in September, we may see the green gradually
draw in towards the central stem, and the
brown papery borders widen, just as if something
were squeezing and crowding the pulp of
the leaf, inch by inch, back through the leaf
stem into the twig. The last traces of green
linger along the sides of the veins, and before it
falls, even these leaf channels will be drained
dry.</p>
<p>When the leaves of a sugar maple give up their
pulp there are wonderful changes inside each
leaf. A yellow liquid fills the cells where the
green pulp used to be. Chemical changes in
the mineral substances deposited in the leaf cells
produce wonderful shades of red and yellow,
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
which glow where once the leaf was solid green.
Iron is one of the minerals brought up in the
soil water, left in the leaf, and changed to produce
the bright red when the leaf mask of green
is taken away.</p>
<p>The scarlet maple remembers its name in the
autumn days. It puts on a cloak more brilliant
perhaps than the sugar maple, which has a good
deal of orange as well as red in its autumn foliage.
The scarlet oak is amazingly brilliant; so
is the sassafras and the sweet gum. The tupelo,
or sour gum, also called the pepperidge, has
foliage that is splashed and streaked with various
shades of red and yellow. Each little leaf is
so brilliantly polished that the tree&rsquo;s beauty and
colour seem to be doubled by reflection. The
sumachs of the roadside thickets wear foliage
of scarlet, each leaf drooping away from the
fruit pyramid which rises, a deeper crimson, on
the end of each upright shoot. The foliage and
the fruit together make a colour harmony that
is dazzling, indeed.</p>
<p>In contrast with its umbrellas of red leaves
are the scarlet berry clusters of the flowering dogwood.
This tree has the habit of snuggling up
against the trunk of large forest trees and reaching
its white flowery arms out to us in spring.
How wonderful they are, on the edge of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
woods, with the green leaves of the larger trees
making a background for their flowers! In the
autumn the same surprise awaits us, when under
a towering tree with yellow or russet foliage,
the dogwood leaps up like a scarlet flame, against
its dark background, holding straight out its platformed
branches of red leaves, tipped with berries,
like rubies, set on the upturned twigs.</p>
<p>Often the trees are stripped by birds before
the berries are ripe. It is in woods where the
trees are numerous that we shall find the fruit
reaching its perfection of ripeness and colour.</p>
<p>Among the trees that turn to purple in the
autumn we may name the white oak and the
ashes. Many oaks turn from green to russet,
without showing any red or yellow. The lindens
and the tulip trees and the beeches turn yellow;
so do the poplars and willows, the hickories,
and walnuts. Up and down the street you may
see the yellow crowns of the silver and the Norway
maples, and on the lawns the white birches
have also turned to gold. The deepest red is
on the black and red oaks. The brightest red
is on the scarlet oak.</p>

</div>
<p>It is not fair to charge Jack Frost with all
the gay colours of the autumn woods. Perhaps
I should say, rather, that he does not deserve
all the credit people give him for painting the
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
landscape with the sunset glories of the dying
leaves. The cause is the ripening of the leaves
themselves, as I have already explained. Frost
may hasten the process, but if a heavy freeze
comes in September, before the leaves have
coloured, we lose our chance for autumn colouring
that year. The leaves drop as if scalded,
and the trees lose their leaf pulp, which they
had expected to withdraw and save for future
use. A long dry autumn of warm days and
mildly frosty nights produces the finest succession
of colours.</p>
<p>Countries that have a more moist, warm
climate than ours, do not have the vivid autumn
colours that we enjoy. England, and the countries
of Western Europe, are like our West coast
in lacking the colour changes that make October
for us the most glorious month of the year. Our
New England woodlands and the forests of Canada
are matched in brilliancy by the wooded
slopes of the Swiss Alps, and the forests along
the Rhine and the Danube. In our Southern
states there is little or no change that comes
to the foliage towards the end of the year. The
leaves on the trees of Florida are lazy in falling.
They wait until pushed off by the swelling buds
in early spring. Many trees that shed their
leaves promptly each autumn in the Northern
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
states, gradually become evergreen in the Southern
parts of their range. The longer a tree
carries its leaves, the more battered and worn
they become. A tree with fresh, new leaves
mingling with old ones is not a pleasant object,
at least to Northern eyes. This is the way most
trees in the South look in spring.</p>
<p>If we should travel the world over, and see
the trees of many lands, in spring, in summer,
in autumn, and in winter, I believe we should
all come back to the clean, beautiful mixed woods
of our north temperate zone, and declare that
these woods are the most beautiful in the world.
In the dead of winter, they are budded full of
promise. We learn to love them as well in this
period of rest as we do in the beauty of their
spring flowers, or in the glory of their autumn
colouring, or in the steady growth of summer.</p>
<p>Each leaf is nurse to a bud that is growing
between its base and the twig. Find these little
buds on any tree with broad leaves. A part
of all the food that passes that way stops to
feed this growing bud; and in the late summer
the twig provides for the future welfare of all
its buds. The thrifty tree withdraws the green
pulp from its leaves, before it lets them fall. A
store of starch is put away in the twig, close
to each bud. This is the food supply which will
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
be used in the spring to enable the bud to open
and spread its young leaves, or its flowers, in
a surprisingly short time.</p>
<p>When the worn-out leaf has been drained of
all of its pulp, the tree lets it go. It has done
its work, and given up its pulp to be stored in
the twig for future use. It seems as if the
tree knows that, with the coming of cooler
weather, growth must stop; that the tender leaves
must die when frost overtakes them. So it is
a frugal habit to save all of the good green leaf
pulp, and to cast off only the dry leaf skin.</p>
<h2>TREE STUDIES IN THE WINTER</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h3 id="c26">TREES WE KNOW BY THEIR BARK</h3>
<p>Hunters and foresters who spend much
of their time in the woods learn to know
trees by name through long acquaintance. In
the dead of winter, the framework of a tree may
be enough to recognise it by. Where trees are
crowded, this sign is not to be depended upon.
The bark is often a guide to the tree&rsquo;s name.
The forester will tell you that the bud is the surest
sign of all. The bark is one of the best signs.</p>
<p>It is not the easiest thing in the world to learn
to know trees by the bark alone. To the beginner,
so many trees with dark, furrowed bark
look strangely alike, although the trees are not
even related to each other. The foresters began
with trees that have peculiar and easily recognised
bark. So we shall begin here, and hope
that the hard cases will gradually become easier.</p>
<p>Every tree wears a garment of bark from the
ground up to the utmost twigs. The thinnest
bark is on the youngest branches. The thickest
is on the trunk.</p>
<p>Begin with the white birch upon the lawn.
The bark of this tree is made of thin layers;
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the outer one shining like white satin. It breaks
and tatters, and peels off around the trunk.
Three-cornered patches of black are found under
each branch, and others on the trunk show where
branches once came out, but were broken or cut
off.</p>
<p>Do you notice narrow, horizontal slits of different
lengths on the birch bark? These are
breathing holes that let the air in to the layer
under the bark. Spongy, porous substance fills
these slits, but allows the air to pass through.
At the lower part of the trunk the satiny outer
bark is shed, leaving dark under layers, rough
and checked into irregular blocks. As the tree
grows older, the trunk becomes rougher and
darker, but the branches always show the kind
of bark that the little tree wore.</p>
<p>In the Northern woods the white bark of the
canoe birch is stripped from the trees in layers
as thick as sole leather. Out of these the Indians
once made their bark canoes. Now the same
material is used for making all manner of trifling
souvenirs to sell to tourists. A square of this
thick bark, cut on the smooth side of a trunk,
may be split into a great number of thin sheets.
This the camper uses to write letters upon, and
it is a beautiful and fitting substitute for note
paper, when one is camping out.</p>
<div class="img" id="p103">
<img src="images/p103.jpg" alt="We recognize birches by their silky, tattered bark" width="500" height="783" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">We recognize birches by their silky, tattered bark</span></p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="p104">
<img src="images/p104.jpg" alt="The beech trunk is clothed in smooth, pale grey bark" width="500" height="764" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">The beech trunk is clothed in smooth, pale grey bark</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>It is a great pity that so many beautiful trees
are girdled and killed to supply the needs of
camping parties. If the bark were stripped but
part way around it would not kill the tree.</p>
<p>The yellow birch has a silvery yellow tint in
the outer bark, which curls back in ragged ribbons
until the tree gets old. The red birch
writes its name in the rusty red colour of its papery
bark, which splits into tatters in true birch
fashion, and flutters the ragged ends from each
branch throughout the year. The black birch
has no tattered ribbons flying, but wears a close,
smooth, black bark, with the narrow slits that
all birches show. As the trunks grow larger
the surface checks into irregular plates, separated
by furrows. It is called the cherry birch, for
the bark is like that of cherry trees.</p>
<p>The sycamore has bark which is different from
that of every other tree. Indeed, it is by the
bark that we recognise this tree. The tall trunk
looks as if it were blotched and streaked and
spattered with whitewash, from the trunk to the
topmost limb. The bark is continually dropping
off in thin, irregular plates, leaving smooth whitish
patches of an under layer exposed. After
sycamore trees grow older, the bark of the lower
portion of the trunk stops shedding. Fine-checked
plates of rusty brown cover this oldest
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
portion. But even on the oldest and largest
trees, the pale blotches are seen in the branches
and we shall never mistake the name of the
tree.</p>
<p>The shagbark is one of the rugged and shaggy
trees that boys find hard to climb without tearing
their clothes into tatters. The bark gives the
tree its name. Thin, narrow plates, close-woven
and tough as sole leather, seem to be attached
very loosely to the body of the tree, but if you
try to pull off these narrow strips, you find their
hold is very firm. Often they are attached at
the middle, and spring out at both ends.</p>
<p>An old shagbark tree is a picturesque figure,
as it lifts its bare arms up toward the wintry
sky. The trunk is straight, but the branches are
full of angles. Yet, with all their rigidity, these
limbs have an expression of strength, if not of
grace, and the tree&rsquo;s head is usually symmetrical,
and always full of character.</p>
<p>A young hickory has smooth, close-knit bark like
that on the branches of the older trees. Gradually
the growing trunk becomes furrowed, and
the peculiar splintering and splitting of the bark
is seen only in trees six inches or more in diameter.
By the time the tree is old enough to bear
nuts, it has built itself a formidable fence that
boys must climb over with much hard work and
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
many a scratch, to get up among the branches
and shake down the nuts.</p>
<div class="img" id="p107">

<br />Center: Silky bark of black birch
<br />Right: Close, sinewy bark of hornbeam</span></p>
<p>The tasteless pignuts grow on a smooth-barked
hickory tree, very easy to climb, but the
bark of the little shellbark hickory is the guide-post
that leads to the trees where the sweet-flavoured
hickory nuts grow.</p>
<p>The close-knit, grey bark of beech trees hardly
needs to be described. The temptation to cut
initials on beech trunks is more than folks with
pocket-knives can resist. No matter how many
fine trees there are in a beech grove near town,
they are scarred all over with letters and hieroglyphics
as far as hand can reach. The tree
never covers these wounds. Though they do
not cripple it, they mar its beauty painfully.</p>
<p>A little further from the haunts of picnic parties,
we shall come upon beech woods that have
not thus been abused by thoughtless jack-knives.
From the ground, far up into the high tops, a
close, beautiful garment of ashy grey bark
clothes the tree. Saplings of all ages grow up
among the big trees, for beeches grow in colonies.
A soft radiance from these many pale tree trunks
seems to lighten the woods paths, overshadowed
by the dense foliage of the tree tops.</p>
<p>It is said that beech trees die when they come
into contact with civilisation. Fine beech woods
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
are included in additions to towns; you will see
the great trees die when lawns and gardens are
made about their roots. In the outskirts of Indianapolis
there are noble beech trees, but they
are dying, as the city grows around them.</p>
<p>The copper beeches and the cut-leaved and
weeping beeches have the same close-knit bark
as our native tree, but it is not grey, but dark
brown. These fancy forms are varieties of the
European beech, one of the principal lumber trees
of the Old World.</p>
<p>The bark of this tree played an interesting
part in the early history of the human race.
Long before the European tribes had written
languages, they sent messages from one to another.
These messages between tribes, friendly
or warlike, were written in hieroglyphics, cut into
the smooth surface of beech bark, and messengers
carried them back and forth.</p>
<p>Sheets of beech bark, as well as birch, made
the walls and roofs of the huts in which people
lived. Their boats and various household utensils
were made out of beech wood, which is so
close-grained that vessels made of it hold water
without leaking.</p>
<p>Another American tree with bark like the
beech, but darker grey, grows always, by preference,
with its roots in wet soil. It is a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
tree, with rigid, horizontal twigs, that form a flat
tree top. This is called the blue beech, and its
trunk does often have a bluish cast. It is also
called hornbeam, for its wood is so hard that
it was used in the early days to make the beams
which went across the horns of the oxen. This
is the part of the ox yoke which is the most
subject to wear. Ironwood is another name that
describes the hard wood.</p>
<p>We shall notice that this tree has not a regular
cylindrical trunk like that of a beech. Strong
swellings, that look like muscles, are seen, especially
where the trunk branches into the main
limbs. Have you ever noticed the arms of a
blacksmith, or of an athlete? How the veins
and muscles stand out when the arm is in use!
Just like them are the irregular swellings that
course up the trunk of the hornbeam, and out
into the limbs.</p>
<p>The hackberry is a handsome shade tree, which
might, at first glance, be mistaken for an elm.
The bark is different from that of any other
tree. Once we see a hackberry, and learn its
name, we will never mistake it again. The bark
is light brown or grey, and finely checked by deep
furrows. The ridges between bear strange,
warty outgrowths. Look for these warts among
the small branches. The twigs are smooth, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
back a little way the warty eruptions begin, and
become more prominent as the limbs thicken and
approach the trunk. Sometimes the limbs have
these warts so close together as to form continuous
ridges.</p>
<p>Another tree with warty bark is the sweet
gum. The negroes of the South call the tree
&ldquo;alligator wood,&rdquo; because the lower part of the
trunk is broken by furrows and cross-furrows
into horny plates like the skin of an alligator.
From the red-brown trunk up into the grey
branches, there is a change in the character of
the bark. The fissures usually run lengthwise,
and the bark rises in thin ridges on each side
of the fissure. These ridges become thin as
knife blades on the smaller twigs, which also
have a sprinkling of small warts.</p>
<p>A sweet gum is very rugged looking in the
dead of winter, with its warts and ridges breaking
out on each limb. We know it by this sign
alone, but are doubly sure when we see the seed
balls dangling from the twigs. The sycamore,
blotched with white on trunk and limb, also carries
a load of dangling seed balls throughout
the winter. There is no danger of confusing
these two trees, for the bark of each is so distinct.</p>

</div>
<p>A little tree with alligator skin bark grows
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
North and South, and chiefly in the eastern half
of the country. This is the flowering dogwood,
whose grey bark breaks into small squarish plates.
There is no such ruggedness in its trunk as there
is in the sweet gum&rsquo;s, for it is always a little tree,
and the bark corresponds in its checking to the
tree&rsquo;s size. When we see this peculiar type of
bark in the winter woods we may look also for
little flattened, box-like flower buds, each enclosed
in four scales. We shall also find the
twigs set opposite, and with these three signs
be sure we know the tree.</p>
<p>A little tree, no larger in girth than the dogwood,
but often taller, has bark that strips and
loosens somewhat as the bark of the shagbark
hickory does. This is the hop hornbeam, one of
the ironwoods. Its bark strips are always thin
and narrow, no matter how old the tree becomes.
It is never as loose upon the trunk as the shagbark&rsquo;s.
The great buds and stout twigs of the
hickory are entirely different from the slender
spray and the very small buds this ironwood
wears in winter. We may find on these twigs
some remnant of the hop-like seed clusters which
give this little tree its name, hop hornbeam. Inside
its shaggy bark the lumbermen find wood
so hard that it is very difficult to work, and when
made into tools it lasts almost forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>When we have learned to know at sight a
dozen trees by their bark alone, we are ready to
go further. A great many trees with furrowed
bark like chestnuts and elms and maples, are
not so distinct as those already learned, and we
must study the tree&rsquo;s form, its winter buds, the
arrangement of these buds, and the shape of
the leaf scars in connection with the bark, in
order to be sure we know the tree&rsquo;s name. The
chestnut from which we gathered so many nuts
last fall, and whose furrowed trunk we saw at
every visit, we come to know through this familiarity.
The trunks of other chestnut trees
look like this one, and though we may not know
just how we do it, we have added the chestnut
to the list of trees we recognise by their bark
alone. The sugar maples which we tap in spring
for their sugary sap, have dark, furrowed bark,
not very distinctive. And yet, by going from
tree to tree, emptying the sap pails, we gradually
learn to recognise the bark of the sugar maple,
and add it to our growing list.</p>

</div>
<p>Trees do not change their clothes, and they
do not move away. Day after day, if we use
our eyes and notice what is going on in the tree
tops, as the seasons follow each other, we come
to know our trees by name; we recognise them
in winter by their bark, and by the framework
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
of their tops, in summer by leaves and flowers,
in autumn by their changing colour and by their
fruits. It is not hard work for those who love
trees. It is like getting acquainted with other
neighbours whom we are glad to count among
our friends.</p>
<h3 id="c27">TREES WE KNOW BY THEIR SHAPES</h3>
<p>The life of every tree depends upon its success
in holding its leaves out into the sunlight.
The tree which exposes the greatest
amount of leaf surface to the sun makes the
greatest growth. The shape of their tops is a
character in which trees differ widely. We shall
come to know many of them in winter time better
than in summer, by the distinct shapes revealed
when the foliage is gone. In any bare
tree, the purpose of all of the branching and
branching again, is plainly seen. Each twig and
branch reaches out toward the outer surface of
the dome, or pyramid. Here the buds in winter
are waiting to open, when spring comes, into
leafy shoots. These will cover the tree top with
a dome of green greater than the one of the previous
summer. Their work through the growing
season will lengthen every branch and every
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
root, and add a layer of wood under the bark
of trunks and branches and roots.</p>
<p>The most remarkable tree shape is that of the
Lombardy poplar. The tall trunk is clothed with
many short, close-branched limbs, which do not
spread, as in ordinary tree forms, but grow upright,
so as to lie almost against the main trunk.
The upper branches are overlapped and crowded
by those below them, and so on down the trunk.
The result is a tree shaped like a capital I. In
summer time, the heart-shaped leaves cover the
twigs on the outside of this spire, but the
beauty of the tree top is marred by the dead
branches which have been smothered by the
crowding.</p>
<p>A young Lombardy poplar is handsome as it
stands covered with its twinkling leaves. It
grows rapidly, and is especially striking and effective
in clumps of round-headed trees. It is
like an exclamation point. Architects always
like to have a few of these trees dotted about
the grounds to keep company with tall chimneys
and distant church spires. There is no
shade under trees of this form, though miles of
them are planted along roadsides where they
stand like tin soldiers, all alike. The older trees
look very ragged, for they are unable to shed
their dead limbs, and as old age comes on they
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
send up suckers from the roots that form a little
forest around the parent tree.</p>
<p>Scattered over fallow fields of worthless
ground, the red cedars are allowed to grow. They
are the evergreen counterparts of the slim Lombardy
poplars. Sometimes the red cedar broadens
into a pyramid, wide at the base, but we are
all familiar with the green exclamation points,
dotted over the hillsides, wherever birds have
dropped the blue berries full of seeds.</p>
<p>The pointed firs with their horizontal branches
becoming longer and longer towards the ground,
are good examples of the pyramid form so common
among evergreens. This is the shape of
the spruces, and the pines, and the hemlocks, until
storms have broken their branches, and taken
away the symmetry of the top. The pin oak
and the honey locust send out horizontal branches
of graduated lengths from the central shaft, imitating
the evergreens in shape.</p>
<p>The evergreen magnolia of the South has a
dome like an old-fashioned beehive, pyramidal,
and regular when it grows in sheltered places.
Such a dome is the hard maple&rsquo;s in the North.</p>
<p>Some trees branch low, and their short trunks
break into great limbs whose ample spread forms
a dome much broader than its height. The white
oak in the North and its evergreen counterpart,
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the live oak of the South, illustrate this noble
form. Somewhat like them, but with its dome
elevated upon a tall trunk, is the American elm
with the fan top. The lines of the elm branches
are all curves from the arching limbs that rise
out of the trunk to the flexible twigs which droop
at the extremities of the branches. The dome
of a white oak is made of angular limbs. Even
the twigs are likely to be crooked. No one would
confuse the elm with an oak.</p>
<p>Round-headed trees are many. Go from the
apple tree in the orchard to the red and Norway
maples along our streets. A great many trees
find this form best adapted to spreading their
leaves out towards the sun. Many oaks and ash
trees, the hickories and birches, and the beeches
have widely spreading limbs forming tops that
are oblong in shape. There are trees so irregular
in habits of growth that we shall never
know them by their forms alone.</p>
<p>The winter is the best time to study tree shapes,
for then the framework is revealed. The trees to
study are those which stand apart from others,
so that they have been able to take their natural
shapes. These we shall find growing on the
streets, and in yards, and parks, and in open
spaces in the woods. Where trees crowd each
other in growing, their branches chafe and clash
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
in storms, destroying the buds and leaves, and
bruising the tender bark. Such limbs die of
these injuries, and the whole shape of the tree
top is changed by its losses.</p>
<div class="img" id="p123">

<p class="center"><span class="small">Left: Clustered thorns on trunk of honey locust tree.
<br />Right: Flowers and foliage of the black locust</span></p>
<p>It is hopeless for lower limbs to live in a
dense pine forest. The top branches form so
thick a wall of shade that lower branches die
from lack of sun. It is the same with broad-leaved
trees. In any dense woods, the trees stand
bare as telegraph poles, lifting small heads of
foliage at the top, and competing there with their
neighbour trees for sun and air. It is only when
set apart from other trees that a trunk can keep its
lower branches hale and strong as those at the top.</p>
<p>The weeping habit gives us some strange tree
forms. The Camperdown elm forms a shady
summer-house on many a lawn by arching limbs
which droop to the ground on all sides of the
main trunk. The weeping mulberry has the
same habit. Weeping birches and willows have
such light foliage, and such fine, flexible twigs,
that they look like fountains of green as they
stand among the other trees.</p>
<p>All weeping trees are made by grafting in the
nursery rows. They are not grown from seeds,
and it is not true that they &ldquo;weep&rdquo; because of
being planted up-side-down! This preposterous
notion is not uncommon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h3 id="c28">TREES WE KNOW BY THEIR THORNS</h3>
<p>In winter time, the bare limbs of trees reveal
many strange secrets, which the leaves cover up
in summer. Some trees we may know by the
thorns they wear.</p>
<p>The honey locust scarcely conceals in summer
the three-branched thorns, for which it is famous.
These thorns are twigs, but they rarely bear
leaves. Each is sharpened to a needle point, and
highly polished. Sometimes it is single, oftener
with a main thorn and two side branches; sometimes
short, but often reaching over a foot in
length, and growing stronger and more wicked-looking
with age. Sometimes a honey locust
has a crowded group of these thorns growing
out of the trunk and large limbs. Once in a great
while a honey locust is thornless, growing wild.
From such trees a thornless variety has been
developed. It is, therefore, possible to obtain
from nurserymen trees of this variety.</p>
<p>The unbranched spines of the osage orange
trees make it a formidable hedge plant, and no
fences are needed where green barriers of these
trees grow. Each shining leaf has a spike at
its base, stout and sharp as a needle, and strong
as steel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Two spines stand guard at the base of each
leaf of the yellow or black locust, and each leaflet
has two little spines of the same type. The
basal spines remain after the leaves fall, so that
in winter we shall find these pairs of sentinels
guarding the leaf scars up and down the ridged
twigs. On the thicker stems the thorns are
larger, and the tree is thus well-armed and able
to do duty as a hedge plant, when thickly planted.</p>
<p>These thorns come off with the bark, hence
they are more properly called prickles. They are
not rooted in the wood of the branch as the
thorns of the honey locust are, but they belong
in the class with rose and raspberry prickles,
which are mere outgrowths of the bark.</p>
<p>The hawthorn trees have single spines, some
long and curved, some short, some branched. All
are rooted in the pith of the twig that bears them;
therefore, they are not prickles, but true thorns.</p>
<p>The wild plum trees have a strange habit of
ending their shoots with thorny tips, as if the
branches needed such defence against browsing
cattle. Certainly these stunted, sharp-pointed
twigs are useful as weapons of defence to the
little trees that grow slowly in poor soil, and are
sufferers from poverty and abuse. Perhaps it
is their hard luck that makes them crabbed and
thorny. Wild apple trees show the same tendency
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
to have thorny twigs. The same little trees,
transplanted to mellow soil, grow soft and leafy
twigs, and abandon the carrying of weapons.</p>
<p>Hercules&rsquo; club is a tree which beats the ailanthus
at its own game. Stems ten feet high and
two inches in diameter at the base sometimes
shoot up in a single season. These clubs of
Hercules are covered with spines as thickly set
as on a gooseberry bush, formidable and vicious,
though only skin deep.</p>
<p>On account of its tropical growth, this tree is
planted for ornament in gardens where there is
room. Its leaves are wonderful. They come
out with a rich, silky, bronze sheen in spring,
and when they reach full size are often four feet
long, and more than half as wide. Each one
is branched and branched again, and ends in a
multitude of small oval leaflets. These giant
leaves sway in the summer winds, giving the tree
the grace of a tree fern. In late summer a
great pyramid of bloom rises above the foliage.
Purplish berries, which succeed the flowers, make
a fine showing in fall and winter, when the leaves
have turned to red and gold.</p>
<p>We dare not touch this spiny tree, but we may
come close and admire its wonderful crown of
umbrella leaves, the biggest by far borne on any
tree outside of the Tropics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h3 id="c29">THE NEEDLE-LEAVED EVERGREENS</h3>
<p>In our town and in our neighbourhood most
of the trees drop their leaves before winter
comes, and stand with bare limbs for several
months. Here and there, however, a single tree
stands, wearing the same green leaves it wore
all summer. Everybody knows this tree as an
evergreen. It belongs to a group of trees
strangely different from those around it which
have shed their leaves. Let us see how it differs
from them.</p>
<p>Take the one that is nearest to you, and pull
down one of its leafy, green branches. The
leaves are like green needles, stiff, sharp-pointed,
with waxy resin on the brown twigs, that makes
your fingers sticky. Up in the tree tops strange
oval, brown cones are hanging. Underfoot, a
carpet of dead needles lies thick upon the grass,
and cones, with their overlapping scales spread
much wider than those upon the tree, lie about.
Squirrels have gnawed some of these scales away,
leaving a central spike like a cob from which
the corn has been shelled. Little green cones,
fat and waxy, no larger than your thumb, are
seen near the tips of some branches. You can
see the scales overlapping each other in these,
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
even though they seem to be grown solidly together.</p>
<p>If we walk through the village or the city in
which we live, and stop under each evergreen tree
we come to, we shall find nearly all alike in
these two points: they have needle-like leaves,
and they have cones. The evergreens with
needle-like leaves, and cones on and under them,
belong to four evergreen tree families, whose
names every one would like to know. These four
evergreen families are named pine, spruce, fir,
and hemlock, and they are planted everywhere.
But few people are very sure they know one from
another. It is perfectly right to call them all evergreens,
or conifers, which means cone-bearers.
These names include all the four families. But
it is common for people to call a spruce, a pine,
or a hemlock, a spruce, when the truth is that
one may very easily know these trees apart.</p>
<p>Let us begin with the first needle-leaved cone-bearing
evergreen we meet. To find out whether
this tree is a pine, a spruce, a fir, or a hemlock,
we must ask the tree some questions. It will
answer them. First: &ldquo;Are your needles set <i>one</i>
in a place on the twig, or are they in groups,
or bundles, of <i>more than one</i> at a place?&rdquo; Pull
down a twig and look sharply for the answer.
Suppose there are the leaves in pairs, or in threes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
or in fives, each bundle or group growing out
of a single point on the twig. The answer is:
&ldquo;Not single, but in bundles, more than one at
a place.&rdquo; Towards the end of the shoot you
will find a brownish or silvery sheath binding
the leaves into bundles. Further back, this
sheath may be missing, but the number of leaves
in the bundle remains the same for some distance
back from the end of the shoot. The leaves
begin to fall from the bundles farthest from
the tips, and therefore old. If two leaves is the
number in a bundle, there are never more than
two, young and old. If three is the number,
you will find only threes. If five is the number,
then you will rarely find fewer than this in any
bundle.</p>
<p>All the trees with more than one leaf in a
bundle are pines. All of the rest of the needle-leaved
evergreens have a single leaf at a place
upon the twig. They are the spruces, firs, and
hemlocks. Let us go and look for them.</p>
<p>The very next evergreen we come to we must
put the same question to: &ldquo;Are your leaves
single, or are there more than one in a bundle?&rdquo;
Suppose &ldquo;three in a bundle&rdquo; is the answer; we
recognise the tree as a pine, and pass it by.</p>
<p>Across the street is a tree of different shape,
though an evergreen and a conifer. We see
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the long cones hanging from its drooping
branches, especially near the top of the tree.
Cross over and examine a twig; the needles are
short and sharp-pointed, and they are set singly
in spiral lines on the twigs. Every leaf sits on
a little shelf, or bracket, that stands out from the
twig. Pick up a dead twig under the tree. The
leaves are gone, but these little brackets in spiral
rows wind around the twig. They are horny
and sharp, and would tear your fingers if you
drew the twig quickly between them.</p>
<p>Notice that the little brackets are angled at the
top. Pick up a dead leaf and notice the shape
of its base. The leaf itself has angled sides.
Roll it between your thumb and finger. It has
three or four sides, and at least three sharp
angles.</p>
<p>This is a spruce, and the signs by which we
know it are the brackets on the twig, the thick,
sharp, three- or four-angled leaf, and the stout
twigs, to match the stout leaves.</p>
<p>The next needle-leaved evergreen with cones
we meet we may hope will turn out to be a fir
or hemlock, but the chances are that its twigs will
show two, three, or five needles in a bundle.
What shall we call the tree? A pine, of course,
and pass it by. We need ask no further question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The next tree has stiff twigs with brackets, and
stout, stiff, angled and pointed leaves. Cones
hang down upon its branches. We recognise a
spruce, and go on.</p>
<p>Over yonder is an evergreen which waves a
featherly spray of very slender twigs. There is
scarcely a breeze stirring, and yet the tree is all
a-tremble, and its drooping branches carry a load
of pretty little brown cones. Turn up a branch,
and you notice that the leaves are all silvery
underneath. They are single on the twigs, so
this is not a pine. They part and lie flat, a row
on each side of the twig. This is very different
from a spruce whose leaves stand out all around
the twigs. These sprays are flat, each like a
feather. The leaves are soft, not stiff. They
are blunt, flat, and each has a tiny stem. The
twigs are like fine wire, they are so slender. The
leaves are mounted on brackets, just as the spruce
leaves are, but the brackets are much smaller,
to match the daintier twigs and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a hemlock tree. The tiny leaf stem is the
thing which sets it apart from all other needle-leaved
evergreens. Take a good look before you
go, at the leaf itself, at the slender twigs, with
their little brackets, at the shining upper surface
of the flat leaf and the silvery lining that makes
this tree so lovely as the wind lifts the flexible
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
branches. Pick up a handful of dead leaves,
and notice that though dead and brown, they
show the flat surface with a middle ridge on the
under side, prolonged into the short leaf stem.
The pale lining is not so distinct now.</p>
<p>One tree family remains of the needle-leaved,
cone-bearing evergreen. That is the fir, the
Christmas tree, and its close relatives. Not often
do we plant our native fir, because the trees are
not as handsome, nor as useful as pines, spruces,
and hemlocks. We may walk far before we find
an evergreen which does not turn out to be a
pine, a spruce, or a hemlock. However, it is
near Christmas time. The little firs will be
brought into market in sufficient numbers to supply
a Christmas tree to every house. This is
our chance. We will go to market, and look
at these little trees that stand together, with their
limbs trussed like fowls, ready to be baked. This
is for economy of space in shipping.</p>
<p>The clean, pungent odour of balsam comes
from the bleeding stub, and we see tears of the
whitish wax wherever the bark of a twig or
branch is bruised. These are balsam firs. They
have their name from this fragrant, sticky resin
that leaks from their veins.</p>
<p>First, as to the leaves. We find them single
and spirally arranged, as in the spruce, but there
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
are no brackets on the twigs. Pull off a leaf
and the twig is smooth. The leaves are blunt,
but flattened, and on most of the twigs they
spread, feather-like, on two sides. There are
more of them, however, than on the hemlock
spray. They are white-lined, like the hemlock
leaves, but there are no little leaf stems. The
twigs are stouter than those of the hemlock, resembling
the spruce twigs in size, but they lack
horny little leaf brackets which are so prominent
on spruce twigs.</p>
<p>One reason that spruce trees make poor Christmas
trees is that the leaves fall so soon. Almost
the day after Christmas the floor is scattered
with them. The fir trees keep their leaves for
weeks. This little bracket makes all the difference.
Fir leaves seem to be fastened right into
the twig itself, and made thus more secure.</p>
<p>If it chances that you find a fir old enough
to bear cones, you will see another very distinct
trait of this family. The cones are held erect
on the twigs; the cones of pines, and spruces, and
hemlocks hang down. If you are fortunate
enough to find a fir tree growing, and old enough
to bear its fruit, these upright cones will tell
you the tree&rsquo;s name before you come near enough
to look at the leaves, and to see if the twigs are
smooth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<h3 id="c30">THE FIVE-LEAVED SOFT PINES</h3>
<p>An evergreen with needle-like leaves in
bundles, two to five leaves in a bundle, is a pine.
These bundles are usually bound with a thin,
papery sheath at the base, and set in spiral rows
that wind around the twig. The leaves in the
newest sheaths are nearest the growing tip of
the shoot. Here we shall find the leaves shorter,
some so short that they have not yet got outside
of their sheaths. The silky covering hides
them, as the bud scales on other trees covered the
undeveloped shoot with its flowers and leaves,
wrapped in the winter buds.</p>
<p>The kind of pine depends upon the number
of leaves in a bundle. This is the first thing
to find out when we undertake to determine the
name of a pine tree. All of the vigorous young
shoots have bundles that do not vary in number
of needles. Further back on the limb are leaves
more than a year old. The sheaths are shorter,
or have fallen away entirely. Now the number
of needles in a bundle begins to be uncertain.
We find bundles that have fewer needles than
those on the younger wood. This is because the
older leaves are falling. Finally we reach a
point where the twigs are bare. On white pine
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
shoots it is easy to find leaves that are five to
seven years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft pine&rdquo; is a lumberman&rsquo;s term. Carpenters
use it, so do all people who work in wood.
It means that the wood of a certain group of
pines is soft and light, and the sap is not gummy.
Any boy who has cut kindling wood knows what
a joy it is to whittle soft pine. Until a few
years ago, this was the wood out of which boxes
of all sorts were made, and it was the only kindling
wood we had. Now things are changed.
Much box lumber is made of poplar and other
soft woods, which do not split as easily as pine.
This means that soft pine is getting scarce, and
is too valuable to use where cheaper woods will
serve.</p>
<h3 id="c31">THE WHITE PINE</h3>
<p>The white pine has the softest, most hair-like
leaves in the whole pine family. Five needles are
in each bundle, and each is delicate and flexible.
When the wind blows through the top of one
of these five-needled trees, the end shoots nod
like plumes. The tree sends up a straight shaft
sometimes to the height of nearly two hundred
feet, and whorls of branches, five in a place,
form regular platforms extending horizontally
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
from the trunk. Each of these sets of branches
counts a year of the tree&rsquo;s life; for the end bud
lengthens the trunk, and at the same time, five
buds that surround it grow out into horizontal
branches. It is easy to count the age of a young
white pine, by beginning at the tip, and counting
downward. We could do it with large trees,
except that the lower branches die, and at length
are lost. The bark heals over the scars left
where they fell, so the count is lost when we
reach the point where the branches stop. The
white pine is slow to shed its dead branches.</p>
<p>In the woods of the Eastern half of the United
States any five-leaved pine that we meet is a white
pine. Before we are near enough to count the
needles in a bundle, we may count five branches at
a whorl around the trunk, and this determines
the name. Beautifully regular pyramids, the
little trees are. In old age these pines lose
symmetry by the loss of limbs, and become very
rugged and picturesque. A white pine tree,
crippled by two or three centuries of struggle
with winds and lightnings, is a noble figure. The
plume-like branches soften its rugged outlines,
and the sombre blue-green of the older leaves is
brightened by the fresher colour of the new ones.
The upper half of the tree is hung with slim
cones whose smooth, thin scales spread wide in
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the autumn of their second year to let the winged
seeds go.</p>
<p>In spring the clustering catkins of staminate
flowers look like yellow cones on the ends of the
pale yellow-green shoots. The wind shakes an
abundant supply of golden dust out of these
pollen flowers, then lets the fading catkins fall.
The pistillate flowers are pinkish-purple and almost
hidden, just back of the tips of the upper
twigs. They are cone-shaped, and they part
their scales and stand erect to catch the pollen
as it drifts through the tree tops. The flowers
on each scale require a grain of pollen each, in
order to set seed. When its flowers are fertilised
the cone closes its scales tight, but they stand
erect all summer. In the autumn they are green
and fleshy, and they turn downward. In winter
we shall see among the swaying branches of these
pines, the green, half-grown fruits, and further
back, on wood a year older, the brown, full-grown
cones with their scales spread. These
cones often curve slightly. The largest of them
may be ten inches long, but the average cone is
little over half that length.</p>
<p>The lumbermen have stripped the white pine
from the Eastern forests until there is very little
left. Many states are planting this valuable timber
tree, to restore the forests that wasteful lumbering,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
and forest fires have destroyed. Thousands
of young trees grown in nursery rows are
transplanted to beautify home grounds and parks.
We shall find no difficulty in discovering white
pine trees, even though no forest near us has a
specimen left. It is one of the commonest pines
to be planted in cities and villages. It is the
only five-leaved pine that will grow successfully
on this side of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h3 id="c32">THE GREAT SUGAR PINE</h3>
<p>All along the coast mountains from Oregon to
Lower California, a five-leaved soft pine grows
whose size makes our Eastern white pine seem
like a dwarf. In that far country of big trees,
it is one of the giants. I had read of these trees
which grow to be over 200 feet in height, with
trunks six to ten feet in diameter at the ground,
but figures do not give much idea of the truth.
I first saw the groves of sugar pines miles ahead
of us, as the stage climbed the foot hills of the
Sierra Nevada mountains. We were on the way
into the wonderful Yosemite Valley. The
scrawny, grey, digger pines, with cones as big
as a man&rsquo;s head, grew on the lower foot hills.
Next came the great yellow pines, and still higher
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
up, the grand sugar pines, along the highest level
of the stage road. They stood oftenest in close
ranks so that their tops were small, because of
the crowding. And here they had stood for
centuries. The road was no wider than the broad
stumps of some that had been cut down, and
their prostrate trunks were longer than any log
I have ever seen before. I remember calculating
that the round dining table at home could be set
upon this stump, and all the family seated round
it with no danger of their chairs being too near
the edge. The standing trunks seemed like great
builded columns, too large for real trees to grow.
Their feathery, dark green tips reached nearer
to the sky than any trees in Eastern forests.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">Pine twig with cones, young and old, and clustered staminate flowers</span></p>
</div>
<p>Under these pines old cones were lying. They
were big, to match the trees. Twenty inches the
longest one measured, with scales two inches long,
and plump seeds as big as navy beans. Far
off in the tree top the hanging cones looked
moderate in size. We could just see the green,
half-grown cones nearer the ends of the branches,
for this Western white pine, like our Eastern
species, requires two years to mature its fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why call them sugar pines?&rdquo; I asked the
stage driver. He pointed to some drops of resin-like
substance on the scales of the cone I held in
my lap. &ldquo;Taste it,&rdquo; he said. I did, and it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
sweet, with somewhat the flavour of maple sugar.
Crystals of this sugar come from wounds in the
bark, and from the ends of green sticks when
burning. The sap is quite as sweet as that of
maple trees, but one is soon surfeited in eating
the candy-like substance.</p>
<p>The stage driver told me that a lumberman
could cut $5,000 worth of lumber from one of
these sugar pine trees. No wonder they think
that it is a burning shame for the government
to reserve these noble woods of the Yosemite
tract &ldquo;just to be looked at.&rdquo; Fortunately for
us, and for the people of the whole country, some
thousands of acres of magnificent forest are
reserved on those Western-mountain slopes, where
they are safe from the lumberman&rsquo;s axe. If
we cannot go to see them this year, perhaps we
can fifty years hence. They will still be standing,
still growing, these noble remnants of the grandest
forests of any country. Specimens of what
Mr. John Muir calls &ldquo;the largest, noblest, and
most beautiful of all the seventy or eighty species
of pine trees in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c33">THE NUT PINES</h3>
<p>A group of soft pines, with fewer needles than
five in a bundle, grows on the Western mountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
slopes. Small trees they are, which have to
struggle hard against the winds and storms, and
with the scant moisture of the desert air and
soil for a bare living. They are very interesting
because of the fact that they have nuts, rich,
sweet, and nutritious, under the scales of their
cones, and these nuts are important items in the
food of many Indian tribes of the West.</p>
<p>The first is the four-leaved nut pine that
grows on the barren mountain slopes of Southern
and Lower California. It is a desert tree, rarely
reaching forty feet in height, and this only in
the most favourable situations. The foliage is
pale sage green. No other pine has four leaves
in a bundle. Its nut-like seeds are rich in oil,
starch, and sugar. Without them the Indians of
Lower California would probably starve. In
Riverside County the tree is common at 5,000
feet above sea level. It has a regular pyramidal
head, when young, becoming low, round-topped
and irregular when very old.</p>
<p>Another pi&ntilde;on, but this one with a bushy, broad
top, and often considerably taller, grows with
the four-leaved pine on the mountains of Lower
California, and northward along the canyons and
mountain slopes of Arizona. The short leaves are
dark green, and there are but two or three in a
bundle. The seeds are plump, and rounded, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
angular. The upper side is brown, the lower
side black, and each has a pale brown wing.</p>
<p>A third nut pine, or pi&ntilde;on, two- or three-leaved,
grows on the eastern foot hills of the outer ranges
of the Rocky Mountains, on both sides of the
system. Forests of it are found on the high
plains of Colorado and Arizona. It sometimes
grows large enough to be used for lumber. The
nuts are half an inch long, and have thin, brittle
shells. They are gathered by Indians and Mexicans,
and may often be bought in the markets
of Colorado and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The one-leaved nut pine seems to belong
with the spruces and firs, and other single-leaved
evergreens, but there are frequently two leaves in
the bundle, and there is a little scaly sheath at
the base. The grey-green leaves often hang on
for ten or twelve years. The winged nuts are
over half an inch long. The wood furnished
fuel and charcoal to the smelters in the mining
regions, and the Indians of Nevada and California
harvest the nut crop.</p>
<p>Every autumn when we are going for chestnuts
and hickory nuts in our Eastern woods, we
may think of the Indian families who leave their
homes in the lowlands, and climb the mountain
slopes to gather their nuts which are their staff
of life. If we should miss our nutting excursion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
it would make no vital difference in our lives
during the coming winter. Our nuts are not a
serious part of the provisions of the household.
But with the Indians, to miss the nut pine harvest,
means to have no bread for the winter that is
coming.</p>
<p>Mr. John Muir, who has often lived among
these stunted upland forests, and seen the Indians
gathering the nuts and using them later as food,
tells us many interesting things. The trees of
the one-leaved nut pine are low, like old apple
trees, and full of cones. The Indians get long
poles, and beat the cones off the trees, then roast
them on hot stones, until the scales open. Then
they shake out the nuts, and gather them in
baskets and bags to carry home. These nuts
are eaten raw or parched on hot stones. These
are the easiest and simplest ways. But the best
and most palatable form in which they are prepared
costs much more time and labour. The
nuts are parched, then ground or pounded into
meal. This is stirred up with water, into a kind
of mush, which is formed into cakes and baked.
This is, in general, the way in which all pine nuts
are made into bread.</p>
<p>The time of the nut harvest is, for the Indians,
the merriest time of the year. If the crop is
heavy, the spirits of the party are light. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
single family, if it is fairly industrious, can
gather fifty or sixty bushels of these rich,
thin-shelled nuts in a single autumn month; and with
this quantity to carry home, can go down the
mountains, tired but happy, knowing that their
bread for the winter, and plenty of it, is assured.</p>
<h3 id="c34">THE HARD PINES</h3>
<p>The hard pines are a group of needle-leaved
evergreens, whose leaf bundles contain two or
three needles, as a rule. The wood is heavy,
usually dark in colour, and saturated with a
resinous, gummy sap. The common name, &ldquo;pitch
pine,&rdquo; refers to the resinous wood; it is much
harder to work with than that of soft pines.
The most valuable hard pine forests grow in
the Southern states. These are now the chief
sources of pine lumber in the Eastern half of the
continent. They furnish also quantities of turpentine,
pitch, tar, and oil, products of the resinous
sap which saturates the wood of these trees
while they are growing.</p>
<p>One trait of the pitch pines is that they retain
the leaf sheath. The soft pines shed the sheath
as soon as the leaf bundle has attained its full
length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h3 id="c35">THE SOUTHERN PITCH PINES</h3>
<p>The woodwork and floors of a great many
houses of moderate cost are done to-day in
Southern pine, sometimes called &ldquo;yellow pine,&rdquo;
sometimes &ldquo;curly pine.&rdquo; The alternating bands
of dark and light yellowish brown, often very
much waved, give the wood an ornamental grain
that is much admired. It is common and most
desirable that this wood should not be stained nor
painted, but given the &ldquo;natural finish&rdquo; which
brings out the rich orange colour, and shows at
their full value the wavy bands and intricate
patterns that are the chief beauty of the wood.
The arching timbers that support the roof of a
church are often made of stiff timbers cut from
Southern pines, and dressed only with a coat
of oil, under which time deepens and enriches
the wood&rsquo;s natural colours.</p>
<h3 id="c36">THE LONGLEAF PINE</h3>
<p>The longleaf pine is one of four hard pines
whose lumber is not distinguished by ordinary
carpenters, but is generally called &ldquo;yellow pine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Georgia pine&rdquo; ranks a little higher than the
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
rest. That is the longleaf, which grows over a
territory much greater than the state of Georgia.
This is the chief source of turpentine, pitch, and
tar, as well as one of the very best lumber trees
of the pitch pine group. The most ornamental
wood is that with the curliest grain, and the
narrowest bands of alternating dark and light
colour. It grows slowly in hard, sandy soils
on the damp coast plains near the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>We shall know this tree from all other pines
by the length of its needles. They are twelve to
eighteen inches long, flexible, dark green, shining,
three in a bundle, enclosed at the base in long,
pale, silvery sheaths. They remain on the tree
but two years, therefore the tree top is bare
except for thick tufts of these drooping leaves on
the ends of the branches. If you have never
seen these trees growing in their natural forest
belt, that ranges from Virginia to Florida, and
west to the Mississippi River, or in small scattered
forest patches in Northern Alabama, Louisiana,
or Texas, you may have seen branches or
small trees shipped north to be used for Christmas
decorations. In the waste land that the lumbermen
have cut over, in the neighbourhood of these
longleaf forests, men go in early December, and
cut the little trees. Saplings two or three feet
high bring good prices in the Northern markets,
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
where holly branches, ropes of ground pine,
sprigs of mistletoe, and leaves of Southern palms
are sold. A little two-foot longleaf pine, standing
erect, with all its long flexible leaves bending
outward like a fountain of shining green, is handsomer
than any palm of the same size.</p>
<p>The popularity of these pine shoots is growing,
and those who cut them seem not to realise that
they are killing the forests of the future. Trees
grow from seeds which fall in the territory
cleared by the lumbermen. If these little trees
that Nature plants are cut as fast as they show
themselves above the forest floor, how are the
longleaf pine forests to be restored? It is a
great problem, for a great part of the natural
wealth of the South is in these lumber tracts, now
being cleared at a terrific rate of speed, and the
land left practically worthless when stripped.</p>
<p>The cones of the longleaf pine are narrow and
tapering. The scales are thick, and each bears a
small spine. The leaves are the distinguishing
trait, and the tall, slender trunk crowned by a
long open head of short, twisted branches.</p>
<h3 id="c37">THE SHORTLEAF PINE</h3>
<p>The shortleaf pine ranks second only to the
longleaf among the forest pines of the South.
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
It is the common &ldquo;yellow pine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;North
Carolina pine&rdquo; that is commonly sold from lumber
yards in the North and Middle West. Its
wood is almost as beautiful in the natural finish.
Its leaves are short in comparison with those of
the longleaf, and scarcely longer than any pines
of the North. They are found in clusters of twos
and threes, and they have the dark blue-green
colour of the white pine, lightened by the silvery
sheaths at the bases of the clusters. The leaves
are soft and flexible, slender, and sharp-pointed.
They vary from three to five inches in length.
The cones are two to three inches long, and half
as broad; the thickened scales have small spines.
It takes two years to bring cones to maturity,
and the old ones hang on several years. In
this they differ from our Northern pitch pine.</p>
<p>Forests of this timber pine are scattered from
Connecticut to Florida, and west to Illinois, Kansas,
and Texas. They are being slaughtered by
lumbermen as fast as those of the longleaf. The
young trees are tapped for turpentine. In the
South and East, these forests are practically gone.
The lumber mills are busy in the great tracts west
of the Mississippi, and below the Arkansas River,
in the forests of shortleaf pine, which until recently
were untouched, and too far from the
markets to be profitably cut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>The shortleaf pine will reforest the old areas,
and spread over a widening territory, if only it
is given a chance. One hundred years is enough
time to restore a forest,&mdash;to grow a crop of these
trees. Young ones spring from the roots of
old trees, a habit not at all common among pines.
Let us hope that before the Southwestern forests
are gone, new ones east of the Mississippi River
will take their places, so that the shortleaf shall
not disappear from the lumber markets as the
white pine of the Northeastern states has done.</p>
<h3 id="c38">THE CUBAN PINE</h3>
<p>The Cuban pine or swamp pine of the South,
with stout green leaves eight to twelve inches
long, in twos and threes, is not confused with
the longleaf nor the shortleaf, for its leaves are
intermediate in length between the two. This
beautiful pine grows in forests that skirt swampy
coast land. Its leaves are carried two years, so
the trees have dense, luxuriant crowns of green,
and are more beautiful as a part of the landscape
than any other forest pine of the South. The
wood of the Cuban pine is not distinguished in
the lumber trade, as it is much the same in quality
and appearance as longleaf pine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h3 id="c39">THE LOBLOLLY PINE</h3>
<p>The fourth of the yellow pines of the South
is the loblolly or old field pine, whose lumber
is saturated with pitch. The trees grow in marshy
regions along the coast, and for the most part
occupy land that is sterile and worthless. These
tide water pine forests follow the swamps from
New Jersey around to Texas. In early days this
was the building pine of the South. The virgin
forests are gone, and the new generation is inferior
in quality, because the trees are not allowed
to attain their full growth. Though rich in resin,
there is little flow of turpentine from these trees,
but the wood catches fire easily, and is one of
the best of fuels.</p>
<p>We shall know this pine by its pale green,
twisted leaves, always in bundles of three, six
to ten inches long, enclosed at the base in sheaths
that are not shed. The cones are three to five
inches long, with ridged scales set with prickles.
This tree bears a great crop of cones yearly,
and its seeds are remarkable for their vitality.
So are the seedlings, which grow on land so wet
or so poor that few other trees compete with them.
The first ten years in the life of a seedling pine
is a period of tremendous growth. Fire rarely
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
sweeps these young forests, for the trees are
well protected by the marshy character of the land
in which they grow. Left for a century or two,
these trees produce masts for the largest vessels,
equal in quality to the finest in the world.</p>
<h3 id="c40">THE NORTHERN PITCH PINES</h3>
<p>We have nothing in the Northeastern states
that compares in importance with the pitch pine
of Southern forests, but we have pitch pines
which everybody knows. The first is the gnarled
and picturesque pitch pine that grows on worthless
land, and thrives in patches along the sea
coast, where other evergreens are unsuccessful.
The rough, rigid branches which spring from
the short trunks of these trees carry a burden of
blackening cones which give them a very untidy
look when the trees are small. When they reach
fifty or seventy-five feet in height, a certain
nobility and picturesqueness of expression challenge
our admiration, and the clusters of cones
are not at all objectionable; indeed they heighten
the tree&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
<p>The needle-like leaves of pitch pines are always
in threes, rigid, stout, and three to five inches
long, dark yellow-green, the bundles in black
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
sheaths that are never shed. The cones require
two years to ripen. They are from one to three
inches long, pointed, with sharp backward-pointed
beaks. The wood of this tree is used for fuel,
and locally for lumber, but it does not interest the
lumbermen. The wood is not good enough, and
the trees are too small and scattered. The tree
does a good work by growing on worthless land,
and near the sea coast. Its picturesqueness is
becoming to be more appreciated by landscape
gardeners who are bringing it into cultivation.</p>
<p>The handsomest of our pitch pines is the red
pine, whose dark green leaves are six inches
long, and cluster in twos upon the twigs. The
bark, the wood, and the bud scales are all red.
The cones are from one to three inches long,
with thickened scales which have no spines. The
tree grows into a broad pyramid, branched to the
ground, with stout twigs, and luxuriant foliage.
The symmetry and vigour of growth makes this
red pine a handsomer tree than the ragged, discouraged-looking
pitch pines. It is well for the
landscape that its wood is very disappointing.
So many beautiful groves are allowed to reach
great age, and size, where white pines would
have fallen to a lumberman&rsquo;s axe.</p>
<p>The home that has a beautiful red pine within
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sight of its windows, or a double row of these
trees serving as a wind-break to ward off the
storms of winter, is truly well planted. Without
one or more of these trees, there is a decided
lack. Any nurseryman can furnish handsome
young red pines, so no one need hesitate to plant
this native tree.</p>

</div>
<p>The Jersey pine is a twisted, low tree, with
dark, discouraged-looking branches, covered with
grey-green leaves that have a sickly yellowish
tinge when the new shoots appear in spring. The
leaves are always in twos, and they range from
one to three inches long. The small cones are
dark red, oval, with thickened scales spiny-tipped.
These trees cover waste land where there is a
meagre living for any tree. What wonder that
they look stunted? Their chief merit is that they
clothe the desert places, and furnish wood for
fuel and fences, and thus save the great lumber
pines for higher uses.</p>
<h3 id="c41">THE CEDARS, WHITE AND RED</h3>
<p>Beside the needle-leaved evergreens just described,
there are some trees we all know, that
bear cones, and are evergreens, but their leaves
are strangely different from those of pines, spruces,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
firs, and hemlocks. One of these is the familiar
arbor vit&aelig;, a conical tree, with flat leaf spray.
Looking closely, one can make out the tiny, scale-like
leaves, arranged in opposite pairs, clasping
the wiry stems, and covering them completely.
These stems are flat, so that one pair of leaves
has a sharp keel on the middle. The next pair
is spread out flat. The keeled pair covers the
edge of the stem. The flat pair covers the
broader surface. These pairs alternate through
the length of the stem, and an aromatic resin
seals them close.</p>
<p>The cones of the arbor vit&aelig; are small, and
they have few scales, compared with the cones
of the needle-leaved evergreens. Each year a
crop is borne, with two seeds under each scale.
Few of us see the little red cone flowers in May,
nor the pellets of yellow on other twigs, which
are the pollen flowers. We watch the hedge
clipper at work, trimming the thick green fronds
that make a solid wall of green. Look carefully
hereafter for the flowers and the ripe cones, in

<p class="center"><span class="small">SCALY-LEAVED EVERGREENS
<br />Upper: two branches from the same red cedar tree
<br />Lower: flat sprays of arbor vit&aelig;</span></p>
<p>The white cedar grows, a fine, conical evergreen
tree, in the coast states, from Maine to
Mississippi. It loves best the deep swamps, but
grows well in wet, sandy soil farther inland.
Here we see again the flat spray of minute,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
pointed, and keeled leaves, but the cones are different.
These are pale grey, and globular; the
few scales are thick and horny, and curiously
sculptured, each with a beak projecting from the
centre.</p>
<p>The foliage mass is a peculiar blue-green, and
the bark, thin, and rusty red, parts into strings
and shreds.</p>
<p>Lumbermen call this tree a cedar. So they
do the arbor vit&aelig;. The wood of each is pale-coloured,
and notable for its durability when
exposed to weather and water. Fence posts of
white cedar, and cedar pails, shingles, and the
like, have a great reputation for durability.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of a red cedar is its fruit.
Instead of a cone, a blue, juicy, sweet berry follows
the blossoming of this tree. The foliage,
too, is erratic. Minute leaves of the scale form,
discovered in the other cedars, are found here on
most twigs. They are still smaller, and the twigs
are much smaller. But on new shoots, and often
on a whole branch, the leaves are needle-like,
one-half to three-quarters of an inch long, and
spreading as the leaves of a spruce. The mass
of the foliage is blue-green; these new ones are
yellow-green. Among the branches hang these
surprising berries!</p>
<p>The truth is that the scales of the cone thicken,
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
and become soft when ripe. They grow together,
and the berry is, therefore, a cone, but much
changed in its development from the cone on
which the fruits of other evergreen trees are
patterned.</p>
<p>We all know a red cedar tree by its tall, slim
shape. The birds eat the berries, and scatter
the seeds far and wide. The trees come
up in irregular clumps in pastures and fence-rows,
and in rough, uncultivated land. They are
pretty widely distributed in the eastern half of
the United States.</p>
<p>The true name for this tree is juniper. That
is the name by which all its related species are
known. Red cedar is the lumberman&rsquo;s name for
its wood, and this name, though not right, will
probably stick to it always.</p>
<p>Red cedar chests and closets are believed to
be moth-proof. The aromatic resin in the wood
is supposed to be distasteful to the insects which
are the pests of housekeepers. To put furs and
woollen blankets and clothing into these chests
does not always prevent their being moth-eaten.
This many people have learned by sorrowful experience.
We know the fragrance of this wood
in pencils. Thousands of trees are cut every
year to supply pencil factories. With the scarcity
of these trees, other woods are being substituted.
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
But who will be quite satisfied, or be persuaded
that cedar pencils are not the best?</p>
<h3 id="c42">TWO CONIFERS NOT EVERGREEN</h3>
<p>Two cone-bearing trees have the astonishing
habit of letting go their leaves in the fall, and
thus setting themselves apart from the evergreens,
to which they are otherwise closely related.
Their cones are like those of pines and
spruces. Their leaves are needle-like, and their
flowers are the cone flowers like the rest. Although
they stand bare in winter time, their
fruits declare their kinships with the evergreen.
Their forms also suggest this kinship, for each
is a spire-like shaft, from which short branches
stand out horizontally like those of the pointed
firs and spruces.</p>
<h3 id="c43">THE LARCHES</h3>
<p>In the Northern states, and Canada, long
stretches of cold marsh land are covered with
solid growths of tamarack, our American larch
tree. In summer the branches are covered with
long, drooping twigs, each set with many blunt
side spurs, from which a tuft of soft, needle-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
leaves forms a green rosette or pompom. The
end twigs have needle leaves scattered their whole
length, after the fashion of the spruces. Purplish
cone flowers, and yellow staminate cones
appear in spring, and in autumn among the leaves
that are turning yellow a crop of cones is ripening.
They stand erect and solitary on the twigs
between the rosettes of leaves.</p>
<p>In winter the long, flexible twigs are bare except
for these cones. The little knobs along the
twigs are the stubs which bore leaves. In the
spring new leaves come out, pale lettuce green,
feathery, transforming the tree top into a thing
of beauty.</p>
<p>This larch tree of ours is more sparsely
branched than the larch of Europe. It looks
ragged and unhappy when planted on our lawns.
It is at its best in the cold North, where it grows
in dense crowds, and the tall trunks are stripped
free from limbs well towards the tops. These
straight shafts are cut for telegraph poles, railroad
ties, and posts. The heavy, resinous wood
lasts a long time in the ground.</p>
<p>The larches planted for shade and ornament are
of the European species, which thrives in any soil.
It has a denser head of branches, and much more
luxuriant crown of foliage than our native species.
It is a beautiful feathery pyramid of green, distinctly
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
different from other trees. In Europe
large forests are grown on the mountain sides,
and from these the tallest masts for vessels are
obtained. The heavy, resinous wood does not
easily take fire as do the pitch pines. The old
wooden battle ships were faced with larch wood
because of this, and because larch wood is so durable
in contact with water. Indeed it has the reputation
of outlasting oak, and the wood of all
other conifers.</p>
<p>In the woods of the far Northwest, and inland
to Montana, the Western larch is one of the
mighty forest trees. Six feet in diameter, and
200 feet in height are not uncommon dimensions
among these giant larches. These trees are of
slow growth, and they stand with their roots
in water or in wet soil, though on the mountain
side. This is an important lumber tree with
wood that has all the good qualities of its family.
In Europe the tree is planted for forests, and as
an ornamental tree. We cannot grow it in the
Eastern United States. It is worth a journey
across the continent to see it growing, one of
the most magnificent trees in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h3 id="c44">THE BALD CYPRESS</h3>
<p>Travellers in the South pass forests of dark
pines, and along the edges of swamps the pines
often give way to solid stretches of trees with
pale grey trunks, and lettuce green foliage, whose
lightness contrasts strangely and beautifully with
the solid bank of dark green that roofs the forests
of pines. A closer look at these strange trees,
which often stand knee-deep in water, is not
so easy. At certain seasons of the year, however,
these swamps are dry enough so that one may
walk dry-shod among them, and so learn to know
the bald cypress of the South, one of the most
beautiful and interesting of native American
trees.</p>
<p>This is the second of the cone-bearing trees
which is not an evergreen. The leaves on the new
shoots are two-ranked, soft and pale sage green in
colour. The stems that bear these plumy leaves
bear also scattered single blades. Among them
are older twigs, tipped with cones, and bearing
branchlets with scale-like leaves scarcely spreading
at the tips. These are much smaller than
the leaves arranged in two ranks, forming
feather-like, leafy branchlets. It is these which
are shed, branchlets, and all, in the autumn, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
fresh in spring renew the feathery grace of the
long, narrow tree top.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing about the bald
cypress is the flaring base of the trunk, and the
root system which seems too large for the tall
but usually narrow top. Knees of cypress rising
out of the water from the main roots, are distinguished
from stumps by their smooth, conical
tops. The base of a great tree often spreads into
wide flying buttresses, each hollowed on the inside,
but serving with the others to support the
hollow-trunked tree. Many a giant of great
age stands thus on stilts whose submerged ends
are the gnarled roots of the tree. From these
rise many smooth, knobbed knees above the surface
of the water in the rainy season. By some
foresters, humps on the roots are supposed to be
necessary to the proper breathing of the roots,
submerged under water so large a part of the
year. The question of what causes these growths,
and of what use they are, is not fully determined.</p>
<p>The cones of the bald cypress are globular, and
about the size of an olive. By them the tree
declares its relationship to the needle-leaved evergreens.
The wood is light and easy to work, but
not noticeably resinous. It is used for buildings,
and for special parts, such as doors, shingles. It
is beautiful when stained, and would be more
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
valuable for interior finish of houses did it not
keep the record of each bump and dent, as all
soft woods do. Buckets and barrels to contain
liquids are largely made of this wood. In railroad
ties it proves very durable.</p>
<p>The best and strangest fact about this tree is
that though it belongs to the South, and is a
swamp tree by preference, it grows large and
beautiful in the North, and in soil that is only
moderately moist. The parks of Brooklyn have
some noble specimens of this bald cypress of the
South. They stand, tall, handsome shafts,
feathered lightly with their short, drooping side
branches, clothed with pale green leaves. There
is no peculiarity of spreading trunk or knees to
disturb the sod that comes up around the base
of the tree. In the autumn the foliage turns
yellow, and drops with the larch leaves. Through
the winter the globular cones are present to
prove this bald cypress a relative of the evergreens,
which are its neighbours.</p>
<h3 id="c45">THE HOLLIES</h3>
<p>No Christmas is Christmas truly without at
least a few branches of the evergreen holly of
the South, whose leathery, spiny-pointed leaves
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
are brightened by clusters of red berries. Every
year, hundreds of crates and boxes of these holly
branches are shipped north from the woods of
Alabama, and other Southern states. Many
people make their living by cutting loads of these
branches, and hauling them to the shipping sheds
where they are packed and put onto the railroad.
The business has grown so rapidly within the
past twenty-five years that holly trees are becoming
very scarce. It has never occurred to
those who cut down and strip the trees that it
takes years to grow new ones, and that nobody
is planting for the future.</p>
<p>Holly wood is white, and very close-grained.
It is admirable for tool handles, whipstocks, walking
sticks, and for the blocks on which wood
engravings are made. The living trees are
planted for hedges, and for ornament. The
leaves are evergreen, and the berries add brightness
and warmth to the shrubbery border when
snow covers the ground.</p>
<p>Although it reaches its greatest size, and is
most commonly found in Southern woods, this
little tree follows the coast as far north as Long
Island. I have found it much higher than my
head, growing wild on the sand bar that separates
Great South Bay from the ocean, east of
New York Harbour. Further north, it is occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
found, but in stunted sizes, and it is
easily winter-killed.</p>
<p>The holly of Europe, which has brightened the
English Christmas for centuries, has a far more
deeply cleft and spiny leaf than ours. Beside
it, our holly leaves and berries are dull, and dark-coloured.
The whole tree lacks the brightness
of the European species. Hedges of this lustrous-leaved
holly shut in many an English garden,
and their bright berries glow cheerfully
through the grey, sunless, winter days. No wonder
the gardeners frown upon the little thrushes
that feed upon these berries, thus robbing the
garden of one of its chief winter charms.</p>
<p>Three other American hollies are found as
shrubby trees in our Eastern woods, but none of
them is evergreen, and the trees are not numerous
in any locality. We shall oftenest see the species
known as the winterberry, whose abundant red
berries remain untouched by the birds, until late
in the spring. Many of these fruit-laden
branches are gathered in the wild, and sold in
cities for Christmas decorations. Sprays of
these berries are often added to the evergreen
holly branches when their own berries are scarce.</p>
<p>Christmas holly is something we cannot do
without. As the supply grows less, the price will
mount higher. Then will come a time when it
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
is profitable to raise these trees in quantities, and
holly farming will be practised in favourable
localities in the Southern states. But that time
has not yet come.</p>
<h3 id="c46">THE BURNING BUSH</h3>
<p>A little tree, not at all related to the holly, but
truly a cousin of the bitter-sweet, has a rather
surprising name. In summer it looks like a
wild plum tree, except for its fluted, ash-grey
bark. The flowers have purple petals, and look
somewhat like potato blossoms. They would
never attract your attention as you pass the tree.</p>
<p>In the autumn the leaves turn yellow, and
gradually the purple husks that cover the scarlet
berries split open, and curl back. Watch the
gradual opening of these husks, and notice, from
some little distance, the gradual reddening of
the tree top, as the yellow leaves fall, and more
and more of the scarlet berries are revealed, as
the husks curl and shrink away from them. It is
in this seed and its husk that the resemblance
and relationship of the burning bush and the
bitter-sweet vine is revealed.</p>
<p>The European spindle tree, and a number of
Japanese and Chinese species, are now planted
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
in American gardens, and called by their genus
name, Evonymus. The red-fruited sorts all come
under the common name, burning bush, and they
do burn with a steady flame when winter has
robbed the gardens of colour. Evergreens form
a beautiful background for these ruddy little
trees.</p>
<h2>TREE STUDIES IN THE SPRING</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<h3 id="c47">THE AWAKENING OF THE TREES</h3>
<p>All winter the grey beech trunks look almost
white among the dark trunks of neighbouring
trees. Their branches are dark at the tips, and
the buds are long, slim, and sharp-pointed. Silky,
brown bud scales, in many layers, protect the
young shoots hidden in these buds. In April
these shoots impatiently push aside their wrappings.
The outer scales fall, the inner ones grow
longer, but the growing tip leaves them behind,
and they fall, while the silky-coated, fan-plaited
baby leaves hang limp and helpless on the lengthening
stem.</p>
<p>No tree of the woods is more beautiful than
the beech as its twigs cover themselves with the
tender green of spring. Beech leaves are <i>handsome</i>
when full grown. In the short hours of
their babyhood they are <i>lovely</i>.</p>
<p>The sturdy shagbark hickory is late in waking.
Poplars and beeches are in full leaf when the
big buds of this familiar tree with the shaggy
bark begin to swell, and show the pale, silky
inner scales under the black outer pairs, which
soon fall off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>The branches are stiff and angular, but the
twigs hold up their big buds, and the trees look
like great candelabra, each holding up a thousand
lighted candles. As the pointed buds push upward,
the protecting scales grow rapidly larger,
and the outer ones turn back like the sepals of
an iris. Wonderful tints of olive and yellow,
violet and rose, blend in their silky covering.
Out of this petal-like frill rises the cluster of
young leaves, small but perfectly formed, and
just as varied and delicate in colouring under
their velvet covering. These complete the flower-like
appearance of the young shoots. The illusion
lasts only until the leaves spread out, and
take on their natural, colour and size. The
scales fall, their duty done, and the flower catkins
come out, under the broad umbrellas of the fresh,
new leaves. The tree is thoroughly awake, and
has begun its long summer&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">Pink and silvery catkins of trembling aspen, and the white, flannel-like leaves, just opened</span></p>
</div>
<p>The poplar likes to grow in moist ground, and
in companies of its own kind. Copses of these
trees, especially if they be young ones, are sure
heralds of the coming spring. Their stems and
branches are smooth, and almost as pale as white
birches. They become greenish, especially the
smaller branches and twigs, as the sap rises.
They are alive from root tips to shining buds.</p>
<p>The brown scales loosen in March on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
plumpest buds. The fuzzy grey pussies push
out, and lengthen into soft chenille fringes that
wave gracefully from every twig. They are grey,
with a flush of pink, an exquisite colour harmony,
too lovely to last. Their catkins fall as
soon as their golden pollen dust is ripened and
scattered by the wind. The plain, green fertile
ones on other trees catch the pollen, and set seed
which ripens, in green, berry-like capsules, in
May. The seeds are almost too small to be seen.
Each floats away with the small wisp of down
in which it hides.</p>
<p>The slim buds on the same twigs open while
the trees are still in blossom. The young shoots
come out, and unroll their baby leaves, soft and
white, covered with a silky down, and tinted pink
under the protective hairs. For a short time only
they look like white velvet, and are limp and
helpless. Then the hairy coat is shed; the leaves
become shiny and bright green, and twinkle in
the sunshine. The stems are flexible and long
and flattened. This makes them catch the breeze,
if the blades do not, so the foliage trembles
whenever a breeze goes through the tree top.</p>
<p>Quaking aspen, trembling aspen, and &ldquo;quakenasp&rdquo;
are popular names given this tree, whose
foliage has the appearance and the sound of
rippling water. Tradition says the tree is forever
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
accursed, and trembles as from fear, because
the traitor, Judas, hanged himself on an aspen.
This is a foolish notion. Only gaiety is expressed
by the continual fluttering of the aspen&rsquo;s leaves.</p>
<p>The buds of cottonwood and Balm of Gilead
trees are sealed with a fragrant wax which softens
as spring loosens the scales and growth begins.</p>
<p>Bees throng these trees, and gather the soft
wax to carry to their hives. They use it to stop
up cracks that would let in the rain. What is
not needed at once they store for future use.
Bee-keepers call it &ldquo;propolis.&rdquo; They have
offered the bees something &ldquo;just as good,&rdquo; but
they will take no substitute for the genuine.
That is produced only on the buds of trees of
the poplar family, and for a brief season it is
ready for them in spring.</p>
<h3 id="c48">TREES THAT BLOOM IN EARLY SPRING</h3>
<p>In late March, or early in April, before the
leaves have come out on any of the trees along
your street, you may look out of an upper window
and notice that strange-looking tassels are hanging
on the twigs of a poplar or cottonwood tree.
Its buds are large and they shine in the sun,
as if they were wet. A day or two later you
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
may be walking with your mother or sister, and
she will be startled to see the sidewalk covered
with what look to her like great red caterpillars!
Then you may remember the tree with the tassels
on it, and recognise them, and explain where they
came from.</p>
<p>A single look shows that this worm-like object
is a catkin, and the lovely red is the colour of
the many stamens that contain the pollen dust.
When this is ripe the stamens burst and let it fly
away. Then the tree lets its catkins fall, for
they have done their part.</p>
<p>Green catkins hang on other trees of the same
kind in the neighbourhood. The flowers are
waiting for pollen that will enable them to set
seed. If the wind blows in the right direction
when the pollen is flying about, the green, fertile
flowers will get all they need. These catkins
are not shed as the red ones are. They make
little show among the opening leaves, but little
seed balls take the place of the flowers. By the
end of May the green balls the size of peas turn
yellow, and open. Out of each pod floats tufts
of white down, each bearing away a tiny white
seed. This is the end of the story. Before the
chestnut trees have begun to blossom, the poplars
have scattered their seeds, and have all the
summer to spend in growing long, supple shoots
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
covered with their dancing, shining leaves. They
look as if they enjoy life!</p>
<p>The pussy willows push their fuzzy noses out
in winter. Some are even showing in autumn.
But the yellow pollen is not seen on these flowers
until the catkins are full grown, and they wait
till winter is past. They dare not risk a frost.</p>
<p>Among pussy willow trees there is a difference
in the catkins. On one tree they turn yellow
when mature; the golden pollen dust rises in a
cloud when the twig is disturbed. These catkins
soon fall off.</p>
<p>On other trees the catkins are greenish, and
they stay on after reaching full size. They are
the fertile flowers, which develop into seed pods.
Pollen brought to them by the wind or by visiting
insects in search of nectar, insures the setting of
seed in these flowers. Though the gayer flowers
fall, they are quite as necessary to the making
of seeds as the fertile ones. In all the willows
and poplars, it requires two trees, bearing the
two kind of flowers, to make the seed. And
the wind and nectar-seeking insects are necessary
as pollen-carriers.</p>

</div>
<p>In marshy land, or by a brook or river, or
even just outside the window at home, there is
a tree that turns rosy in March with a multitude
of small red flowers clustered on the sides of
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
its twigs. It is the swamp maple, the red maple,
the river maple, the scarlet maple. Two of these
names tell of the tree&rsquo;s thirst; two name its
colour when in blossom, and also when the leaves
change colour in autumn.</p>
<p>Each flower is a red bell, for the petals are
red. One has a red forked pistil thrust out;
another lacks a pistil, but has a cluster of yellow
stamens. One tree may be deep red throughout,
having only pistillate flowers. Another may
have only staminate flowers; it will be orange
coloured, by the blending of the colours of the
yellow stamens, and the red petals. Another
tree may have flowers of both kinds. Occasionally
flowers will be found that have both stamens
and pistils.</p>
<p>The bees are in the scarlet maples at the
first loosening of the bud scales. There is nectar
in those flower bells. The colour and a faint
fragrance tell this secret. From pollen flowers
the busy insects carry the golden dust to the
forked pistils that set seeds.</p>
<p>The wind helps by scattering pollen in the
tree tops, and very soon the flowers are gone.
The staminate trees turn green when the opening
leaves lose their vivid red. The pistillate trees
hang out red clusters of winged seeds below the
opening leaf clusters. These red trees keep
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
their name written plainly as long as the seed
clusters swing.</p>
<p>Early in March, the side buds on the elm twigs
begin to swell, and soon clusters of purplish
flowers, small but very pretty, come out of the
largest buds, and the tree top has a purplish haze
upon it, that means that spring is coming. The
bees come to get nectar from these early blossoms,
but few people speak of the blossoming elms.
They do not notice that elms ever blossom; and
are rather incredulous when a spray is shown
them covered with the graceful little tassels.
&ldquo;Who ever <i>heard</i> of elms having flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth is that every tree, when it is large
enough, bears flowers. Not every one bears
fruit, for some have pollen flowers only, the seeds
being borne on the fertile trees. Elms have
perfect flowers, and soon after the leaves open,
the green fruits are seen in clusters, and before
May passes, the seeds, each surrounded by an
oval wing, flutter off in the wind.</p>
<h3 id="c49">THE AMERICAN ELM AND ITS KIN</h3>
<p>Beautiful and stately, yet full of grace is the
form of a big elm tree against the grey sky
of a cloudy winter day. The tall trunk is
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
crowned with many main branches, which spread
into a widening funnel shape, subdividing into
numberless smaller branches, whose direction is
outward and downward. The numerous twigs
have the droop of a weeping willow. The tree
top is wonderful when every limb is bare.</p>
<p>In summer the same tree is a great fountain
of green leaves. The long, leafy twigs of new
wood are flung out to the wind, and the twinkling
blades dazzle the eyes like spray. This is the
time that we love the elm for its shade, and as
an ornament to home grounds and parks. Roadside
elms are the favourite nesting trees of the
Baltimore oriole, whose hanging pocket of grasses
and yarns swings at the end of a high outer
branch.</p>
<p>When winter is still in the air, and snow on
the landscape, the dark twigs of these bare elm
trees change colour. It is the purple flower
clusters that are flung out from opening buds
in late March. It takes sharp eyes to see the
cause of the wine-coloured flush in the tree top.
With the opening of the leafy shoots in April,
the trees get an added colour from the pale green
seed discs that replace the flowers. These are
winged, and they soon turn brown, and fly away
on the first breeze. This is the elm&rsquo;s way of sowing
seeds. A crop of young elms grows each
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
summer in fields and gardens near these seed
trees. The leaf of the seedling is exactly after
the pattern of the parental tree, but smaller.</p>
<p>The English elm is less graceful than our
American tree. It has more the stature of the
white oak. The head is compact, and the foliage
mass thicker, and longer-lived. The robin red-breast
nests close to the sturdy trunk, shielded
by the earliest leaves.</p>
<p>An old couplet guides the farmer in the old
country:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When the elm leaf is as big as a mouse&rsquo;s ear,</p>
<p class="t0">Then to sow barley never fear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The toughness of elm is remembered by all
who have &ldquo;read of the wonderful one-hoss shay.&rdquo;
Nothing but &ldquo;ellum&rdquo; was proper stuff for the
hubs, you know. As it is durable in soil, elm is
good timber for posts and railroad ties. By its
toughness and flexibility, it is fit for waggon
tongues, and all kinds of agricultural implements.
The ancient warrior of England was likely to
carry a longbow made of the tough British elm.</p>
<p>Slippery elms grow more irregular in form
than the American, and are usually smaller trees.
Both kinds grow together in the wooded regions
east of the Rocky Mountains. The difference
between them can be easily detected by a blind
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
person. Twigs, buds, and leaves of slippery elms
are made rough and harsh to the touch by coarse,
reddish hairs.</p>
<p>Boys and many other people like the taste of
the glutinous inner bark of this tree when the
sap is running, and the limbs and trunks peel
easily. Many a tree is sacrificed to this appetite.
The same delectable mucilaginous substance
quenches the thirst and allays hunger,&mdash;so hunters
say, who have eaten it when lost in the woods,
and threatened with starvation. Poultices of it
relieve throat troubles, when there is congestion.
It is a home remedy for inflammations and fevers.
Dried and ground, the rich cambium is mixed
with milk, and forms a nutritious and tasty food
for invalids. It is a staple on the shelves of
apothecary shops.</p>
<p>The rock elm might be mistaken for a bur oak
were the leaves not decided proof that it is an
elm. The limbs are shaggy, and the twigs winged
by the corky bark. Indeed, another name for
the tree is the cork elm. The framework of this
tree is stiff and irregular, a decided contrast to
the graceful drooping top of the American elm,
whose symmetry is one of its best points.</p>
<p>The wood has its fibres so interlaced that no
wood excels it in toughness and springiness.
It is the wheelwright&rsquo;s choice. It makes the
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
finest bridge timbers, and the best axe handles,
and wheel hubs.</p>
<p>The winged elm is the smallest and daintiest
of the elms. The twigs are broadened by a corky
ridge on each side. This gives the tree its name.
The Indian name, Wahoo, is also heard in the
South. The leaves are of the elm type, but
unusually small.</p>
<p>It is seen as a street and lawn tree in cities
and towns south of Virginia, and west to Illinois
and Texas.</p>
<h3 id="c50">THE MAPLE FAMILY</h3>
<p>If you meet a tree of good size, with slender
branches, and small buds set opposite upon the
twigs, you may suspect it of being a maple. The
leaves are needed to assure you. If it is winter
time, and the tree stands on the street, the leaves
may all have been raked away. If the tree grows
in the woods, the chances are that there is a
leaf carpet over its roots, and that most of these
leaves have fallen from its branches. You can
make sure of this point by picking up a dead leaf,
examining the base of its stalk to see if it fits
the leaf scars on the twigs. If the leaves are
simple, that is, if they have a single blade, the
evidence that this is a maple is very strong.
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
There are a few small trees with simple leaves
set opposite on the twigs, but they do not grow
as large as maples.</p>
<p>Does the leaf have three main divisions, each
with a vein which is one of three large branches
of the leaf stalk? Then you may be sure that
the tree is one of the maple family.</p>
<p>Simple leaves, of three main lobes, set opposite
on the twigs, and the twigs set opposite on the
branches,&mdash;in these are the plain signature of
the maples. They write their names in these
characters, across every branch throughout the
growing season, and on the leafless branches, and
the dead leaves under the tree in winter. Another
signature is the one-sided maple key, which
hangs on the trees all summer, and even late
into the winter on some kinds, but is shed in
early summer by a few.</p>
<p>The two early-blooming maples are commonly
planted as street and shade trees all over the
Eastern half of the country. It is easy to recognise
these, and to know them apart by the leaf
alone.</p>
<p>The red maple is a spreading, symmetrical
tree, of medium size with slender, erect branches.
The leaves are red when they open in spring; so
are the flowers which cluster on the bare twigs
in early April, before the leaves are out. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
clustered fruits that dangle in pairs all along
the stems in May are red, and in the autumn the
tree changes its green robe of foliage to scarlet
before winter comes. The buds that cluster at
the joints are red as rubies, and the slim twigs
glow with the same warm colour, which is
warmer by contrast with the snow.</p>
<p>All maple leaves are more or less cleft into
three main divisions. The red maple has two
shallow clefts, V-shaped, at the top, and the lobes
are pointed and triangular. The margins are
irregularly saw-toothed. These leaves are often
downy beneath, and always white-lined when
young. In summer they have pale green linings.
As a rule, red maple leaves are small, averaging
less than three inches in the length of their blades.
They are larger on young trees.</p>
<p>The silver maple is much more easily grown
from seed than the red maple, but it has a far
more irregular tree top. The limbs branch low
on the trunk, and these limbs grow very long, giving
the tree a loose head of great height, and great
horizontal spread. The small branches curve
downward, and the twigs are held erect. The
wind twists and breaks these great weak limbs,
or wrenches them loose from the trunk. It is
dangerous to have these trees near the house, for
wind and ice storms are constantly snapping off
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
branches large enough to break windows, or
knock down chimneys as they fall.</p>
<div class="img" id="p197">

<div class="img" id="p198">

<p class="center"><span class="small">Seeds of red maple, in late May, and in early April</span></p>
</div>
<p>The flowers of the silver maple show no red.
They come out greenish-yellow on the twigs when
the red maple&rsquo;s flowers are glowing on their red
twigs in March, and early April. The leaves
are pale green, white beneath, and set on long
flexible stems. They are larger than the leaves
of the red maple, and cleft in a distinctly different
way. A narrow, deep fissure divides the leaf in
thirds, and two side clefts divide the lower lobes
in two unequal halves. These fissures reach two-thirds
of the way through the leaf blade, and
each lobe is cleft along its sides, into many irregular
bays and capes. These leaves are always
silvery white beneath in summer, and they turn
to yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>In late May the pairs of winged keys hang
on short stems. Each key is about two inches
long, fuzzy green, until ripe, twice the length of
the smooth keys of the red maple, which are
ripening at the same time.</p>
<p>It is good fun to lie under a maple tree, and
watch the seeds as they fall. If the wind is
strong, they shower down like rain. Each key
separates from its mate, and as it lets go its
hold on the twig, the wind catches its thin wing,
and sends it whirling round and round. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
heavy seed makes for the earth, while the flat
blade above it acts as a parachute, or a sail,
to keep it in the air.</p>
<p>How far does a silver maple send its seeds
in these summer days, when they are falling?
It is easy to answer this question by pacing the
distance from the tree trunk in a straight line
to the point where the farthest key falls. Go
in the direction towards which the wind is blowing,
in determining this distance. It will be interesting
to run out another line from the tree
trunk to find out how far the seeds are thrown
on the side that is against the wind.</p>
<p>From the silver maple go to a red maple, and
watch the harvest of these small-winged keys.
Do a little measuring here, and find out if their
smaller size and weight enables these seeds to
sail further in the same breeze than those of the
silver maple.</p>
<p>The sugar maple is known also as the rock
or hard maple, because its wood is harder, and
therefore slower to grow, than the two quick-growing
soft maples just described. This is the
one whose trunk is tapped in spring, and the sap
boiled down in great kettles over an open fire
in the woods. When the water is all evaporated,
solid cakes of maple sugar remain. If you are
walking in the woods in winter, and come upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
any trees bored with small auger holes, several
near the base of each trunk, you may suspect
that this is a grove of hard maples which the
New England farmer calls his &ldquo;sugar bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look at the twigs, and you will see that the
plump round buds are set opposite, and the twigs
are opposite on the branch. This is the way
with all maple trees. Are the branches many,
and do they shoot upward rather than outward,
and form an oval head? This is the typical habit
of young hard maple trees. As they grow older
the heavy lower limbs become horizontal. They
are clean, hardy, vigorous trees, long-lived, dependable,
able to meet the storms, and to suffer
the theft of their rich sap every spring without
apparent loss of strength and vitality.</p>
<p>The leaves come out later than those of the
soft maples. They are firm, and broad, with five
pointed lobes between wide fissures that reach
half-way to the stem. Margins of these lobes
are wavy, never saw-toothed, like those of the
silver maple. They are dark green above, with
paler linings. In autumn they turn to yellow,
orange, and red.</p>
<p>The flowers open in May, shortly after the
leaves appear. They are in thick, hairy, yellowish
clusters. Some are pistillate, some staminate,
in the same cluster. Those with the forked
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
pistils remain and grow into smooth fruits towards
the end of summer. The keys of sugar
maples are short-winged, like those of the red
maple, but have stouter, thicker seeds. They are
shed in late autumn and early winter.</p>
<p>Hard maples are among the best of shade
trees, and the glory of their autumn colouring
makes them one of the most to be desired among
trees planted merely for ornament. A street
planted to hard maples is well planted always.
But people are impatient for trees to grow up.
The slow growth of the sugar maple is discouraging.
It is a good plan to plant the quick-growing
soft maples, and alternate with them the slow-growing
species. For a few years the soft maples
are pretty, and with each year&rsquo;s growth they give
more abundant shade. By the time the wind has
crippled their long arms, and made the trees
unsightly, the hard maples are coming on to take
their places, and they need the room which is
given them by the removal of their neighbours
on to the left and right.</p>
<p>When I went into the woods of Oregon, I found
the vine maple trees, which seems not to have
sufficient backbone to stand upright. These trees
start to grow erect, but their weight soon overcomes
their strength, and they droop, but keep
on growing, with their limbs prostrate on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
ground. The wet land in many places was covered
with a network of the interfering branches
of these serpentine maple trees.</p>
<p>The leaf is about the size of the palm of my
hand, and almost circular. The border is cut
into many shallow lobes. The seeds are characteristic
keys, smooth, and the wings of each
pair are spread almost opposite each other.</p>
<p>The Norway maple is a most popular street
tree. Its foliage is very dense, and the tree
forms a round, symmetrical head. The broad,
five-lobed leaves are remotely toothed, smooth,
thin, and dark green on both sides. Break a
leaf stem, and a milky juice appears. The seeds
are very flat, and have broad, flaring wings. The
flowers are yellowish. Great clusters of them
come out with the leaves. The seeds are ripe in
autumn.</p>
<p>We shall find that the foliage of the Norway
maple stands the wear and tear better than that
of many shade trees. The crown of a Norway
maple turns to bright gold in autumn, and most
of the leaves are still unmarred when they
fall.</p>
<p>The box elder is the one native maple which
has compound leaves. The leaf blade is cleft
quite to the stem, and the thirds form separate
leaflets, each mounted on its own stalk. These
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
leaves are set opposite on the twigs, like those
of other maples.</p>
<p>In spring pink fringes like corn silk decorate
the branches of certain box elder trees. Other
trees of the same kind hide little green flowers
among the opening leaves. The pink fringes are
the pollen-bearing flowers, which fall when ripe.
Staminate trees never bear fruit. All through
the summer the trees which bore the greenish
flower are dangling clusters of pale green seeds,
each with the peculiar wing, which proves it a
maple. When the ragged, yellowing foliage
falls, these seed clusters remain on the branches,
and all through the winter the wind is plucking
and carrying them away.</p>
<p>The wood of box elder is very soft. The tree
is planted because it grows so quickly and surely,
and its seeds are so easily obtained. But broken
branches give the older trees a crippled, unhappy
look, and the ragged clusters of seeds give them
a disheveled appearance all winter. Fortunate
is the man who has planted elms or hard maples
along the road, so that he may take out the decrepit
box elders, and have the better trees coming
on to take their places.</p>
<p>The striped maple is a little tree, which hides
in the woods, and only a few people know the
tree, and love it as it deserves. The stripes are
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
on its smooth green bark, which breaks into a
network of furrows as the stems increase in
diameter. These furrows expose a very pale
under-bark, so that at a short distance the trunk
seems to be delicately traced with white lines.</p>
<p>In its blossoming season the striped maple has
a loose, drooping cluster of yellow, bell-like flowers.
The leaves that surround them are broad
and shallowly three-lobed, and saw-toothed all
around. The seeds are little maple keys, smaller
than those of the red maple.</p>
<p>The mountain maple is another little tree quite
as modest and retiring as its striped cousin. It
has longer, more taper-pointed leaves. The
flower clusters are much smaller than those of
the striped maple, and they stand erect. The
fruits hang late in the winter, on the grey downy
twigs, which are brightened by red buds.</p>
<h3 id="c51">THE WILLOW FAMILY</h3>
<p>One of the first tree families whose name we
learn is the willow family. The members are
numerous, and the botanists find great difficulty
in distinguishing certain species, which
closely resemble each other; but these troubles
we shall leave to the scientist. The point for
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
us to consider is this: When we see a tree which
we know to be a willow, <i>how</i> do we know it?
&ldquo;It looks like a willow,&rdquo; some one says. But
who knows, and can tell <i>how</i> willows look&mdash;how
they differ from other trees?</p>
<p>First, willows have slender, flexible twigs that
give the tree tops grace and lightness. Second,
willow leaves are nearly always long and slim
to match the supple twigs. They are always
simple, and short-stemmed. The wood is light
and soft, so the trees break easily in storms of
wind and ice. An old willow tree is likely to
be crippled, but its scars and wounds are covered
in summer by the arching branches and the
abundant foliage.</p>
<p>The first trees to blossom in spring are the
shrubby pussy willows, a distinct kind whose
catkins are so eager to push out of their scales
that their grey, silky noses are often seen in
November. Frequently, they are out and the
scales dropped in February; but the yellow stamens
and the long-tongued pistils do not rise
above the grey fur until March, at least. The
most attractive stage of these catkins is the earlier
one, when the flower buds are concealed by the
grey silk.</p>
<p>By cutting pussy willow twigs in the late fall,
or any time during the winter, and putting them
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
into a jar of water, we may see the blossoming,
quite out of season. Sufficient food is stored
in the twig to force out the blossoms, even to the
shedding of the pollen. It is a charming thing
in the winter to have a vase of these twigs in
full bloom on a window sill when snow banks
are piled high just outside.</p>
<p>Willows are lovers of wet ground, and we
shall see groves of them scattered along streams
and on the margins of ponds and swamps. A
few species thrive in dry soil, and seem to prefer
it. Some grow at sea level, others are found
on high mountains. From small shrubs they
vary to mighty trees. There is no climate and
no soil that does not have its native willows. The
family is distributed from the Equator to the
Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>It is very common in many places for farmers
to plant a grove of willows for a windbreak,
to protect their houses and barns. This is especially
seen in prairie states and other treeless
regions. Willows are quick-growing trees, and
sure to grow. All one needs do is to cut limbs
from a growing tree, chop these limbs into pieces
the length of stove wood, and drive them into
the ground. Each one takes root, and grows
into a tree, if the soil is at all moist.</p>
<p>Another plan is to cut fence posts from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
willow grove, and drive them into the ground.
Each of these posts forms the trunk of a willow
tree, which soon has a great head of branches.</p>
<p>In Holland and other countries, willows are
thickly planted to form hedges and for their
roots to hold the soil along the banks of streams
and ditches. The same trees may perform a
double service. Willow wood makes good summer
fuel, where a quick, hot fire is desired. The
twigs make the best charcoal used in the manufacture
of gunpowder. The long, flexible twigs
of a low-growing willow are used in the manufacture
of wicker chairs, tables, and other furniture.
These trees are grown on a large scale
in France and other European countries, and the
industry is being introduced in some parts of
America.</p>
<p>When spring comes on, we may notice a peculiar
change in the colour of the bare willows that
line the stream borders. The twigs turn gradually
green, and the long, pointed buds prepare
to cast off their single scales. These are shaped
like the long, knitted caps which children wear in
winter time, although there is no tassel at the
end. The cap fits snugly over the long bud,
and is fastened in a circle at the joint. The
swelling bud simply pushes it off.</p>
<p>Under these trees, we shall find a good many
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
fresh twigs. Reaching up to break one, we find
that it snaps off short at the base. It is not
brittle along its whole length. Try a dozen twigs,
and off they snap, almost at a touch. The wind
has broken off those that fell to the ground.
Some that fall in the water, float away down
stream. They catch on sandbars, and strike root.
Some swing in to the shore, and grow on the
banks.</p>
<p>We have discovered a habit of certain kinds
of willow trees. The shedding of their twigs
at the season when they are fullest of life is
the tree&rsquo;s method of colonising new territory.
These twigs float away, and blow away, and
those which lodge in wet ground before they
dry are almost sure to grow. The billowy acres
of green which cover sandbars and stream borders
are willow trees, children of parents that
grow far up stream.</p>
<p>Along roadsides in this country a large willow
is much planted, whose leaves are pale beneath,
so that they look very cheerful and cool in midsummer.
The most striking thing about these
willows is that their twigs are yellow as ducks&rsquo;
feet, and particularly bright in early spring. The
older trees grow very stout, and great branches
leave the trunk close to the ground. This is the
golden osier willow, one form of the white willow
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
of Europe, which does not grow vigorously
in this country.</p>
<p>The weeping willows, whose long, supple
branches sweep out and downward, sometimes
yards in length, from the tree top, came originally
from Babylon. Who were they in that far
country who &ldquo;hung their harps on the willow
trees&rdquo;? A great many weeping willows in the
Eastern states are said to be sprung from the
parent tree, which grew on the Island of St.
Helena. What famous prisoner probably sat
under the shadows of this willow tree, and
dreamed again of conquering the world? The
weeping willow has the habit of snapping its
twigs off, short, at the base. One of these long
withes, cut into bits with one or two buds on
each cutting, will start as many weeping willow
trees, if the bits are stuck into wet sand and
kept wet until rooted, and then set out and given
plenty of water until they become established in
the ground.</p>
<p>The black willow is named for the black bark
of the old tree. It is the only one of the narrow-leaved
willows whose leaves are uniformly green
on both sides. These leaves are often curved
like a sickle. At the base of each leaf is a
pair of heart-shaped, leafy blades, called stipules.
Many trees have stipules that come out with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
leaves, and are dropped off, but these persist, as
a rule, all summer. The black willow is one of
those with the twigs that snap. It takes possession
of stream borders, and its offspring may
cover miles of new territory in a single season.</p>
<p>The balsam willow we shall know by the fragrant
coating of wax, or balsam, on its young
shoots and buds. Its broad leaves are blunt at
the tip, and look scarcely willow-like, but the tree
is known by its buds and its catkins. To find
it we shall have to go into the boggy regions
in the Northern tier of states, where it is numerous,
but never more than a shrubby tree.</p>
<p>One use is served by no tree as well as a
willow. When the sap rises in spring, the willow
branches are in prime condition to make whistles.
I wonder if there is a boy, in town or country,
who does not know how to make a willow whistle
that will &ldquo;go&rdquo;? Surely not, unless his supply
of uncles and grandfathers is short. You cannot
make a willow whistle by following printed
directions. Some skilful person, who has been
a boy, must show you, and one lesson is enough.</p>
<h3 id="c52">WHY TREES NEED LEAVES</h3>
<p>Spring or early summer is the best time to
study the leaves of trees. They are clean, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
fresh, and new. Every tree is a great mound
of green. The broad-leaved trees seem to be
thatched or shingled with overlapping blades so
that no sunlight can get into the darkened room,
which is empty except for the bare branches that
support this outer dome of leaves. A sugar
maple, or a linden tree, shows best this outer
thatch, which is so thick that the sun is unable
to look through. The bird flying overhead sees
only a solid mass of leaves. The one on its
nest in a forked limb looks up and sees the inside
of this leafy tree cover. She is glad for
the twilight that surrounds her, and for the
coolness of this shady place; but more glad that
her nest is hidden from sight of hawks that sail
overhead, while she keeps a close watch for sly,
thieving red squirrels that may come to steal
her eggs, by climbing up the branches.</p>
<p>What are the leaves for? Why does the tree
put out in spring young shoots with rows of
leaves along their sides? Why does the tree
hold these branches out as far as possible from
the trunk, and bend the leaf stems and the twigs
so as to face the leaf blades towards the sun?</p>
<p>The reason is this: the life of the trees is
in the green layer which we see on the surface
of all green shoots, and which we can discover
under the older bark of twigs, which has turned
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
brown. Following the twig back from its tip,
all of the leafy part is green. Behind it the
smooth twig is no longer green, but a thumb
nail easily strips off the layer of brown, and reveals
the green under bark. Go a little further
back, and gradually the outer bark thickens, and
it is more difficult to get at the soft under layer.
After a while, we shall need a knife to reach
it, for old bark is hard and tough.</p>
<p>When the bark gets so thick that the sun
cannot reach the green layer, the colour fades
out. The living part of the trunk of the tree
is the soft, juicy layer between the bark and
wood. Through this portion of the tree the
sap rises from the roots, and finally reaches the
leaves. This sap needs to be changed before
it can be useful to the tree as food.</p>
<p>The leaves are the places where these changes
take place. Through little doorways in the under
sides of the leaf air passes in. With it goes
carbonic acid gas, an important food element.
The soft green leaf pulp, which is the green juice
of a bruised leaf, has a wonderful work to do.
It cannot do this work unless the sun is shining
upon it. On a bright day every leaf is making
starch, and sending it down through the twigs
and branches as food. This starch is contained
in the sugary sap that flows back constantly from
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the leaves to the farthest root tips. It is made
in the leaves out of the sap brought up from the
roots and the carbonic acid gas which the leaves
absorb from the air.</p>
<p>As long as the leaves do their work, the tree
is able to grow, and to blossom, and to ripen its
seeds. When the leaves have done their work
the summer has passed; the tree lets go the leaves,
and rests without growing all winter.</p>
<p>It is not easy to explain the work of the leaves,
nor even to understand the wonderful work accomplished
there all through the summer. When
we eat, our food must go into the stomach to
be changed by the processes called digestion. It
is hours before the digested food is poured into
the blood and carried to all parts of the body.
The tree takes its food from the air, and from
the soil. Neither the dirty water that rises as
sap to the leaves, nor the gas which enters the
leaf doorways from the air, is useful as food
to the growing tree until they have been combined
and changed. The leaves are, then, in a
sense, the stomachs of the trees, for in them
the raw foods must be &ldquo;digested&rdquo; before they
are ready to be poured into the life blood that
flows down through all the live parts of the tree.
Now they are fit to feed the growing cells, which
are always hungry.</p>

<h3 id="c53">LEAVES OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES</h3>
<p>The leaf of the tree is its visiting card. We
shall learn to know trees by their leaves, as easily
as if the name were written across the face of
the leaf. Some leaves have a single blade of
green, and for this reason the botanist calls them
<i>simple</i> leaves. This blade has a stem that unites
it with the twig. A <i>compound</i> leaf is one whose
stem bears more than one blade. These small
blades are called <i>leaflets</i>. There are two types
of compound leaves, one feather-like, having a
main stem with leaflets arranged in two rows on
opposite sides of this stem. Such a leaf is
feather-like. The other type has a leaf stem
with all the leaflets attached at one end. The
horse chestnut is the best example of this type.
The leaves spread from the end of the stalk somewhat
as the fingers rise from the palm of your
hand.</p>
<p>The biggest leaves with single blades to be
found in our forests grow on trees of the magnolia
family. The silver-lined leaves of the
large-leaved cucumber tree are over a foot in
length, sometimes two and one-half feet, down
South. These great leaves are about one-fourth
as wide as long, and at the base each one broadens
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and extends backward into two rounded ear-like
lobes. This gives the tree the name, ear-leaved
magnolia. The whole leaf flaps in the
wind, like the ear of an elephant, and, of course,
the wind lashes it into strings and soon robs it of
its beauty.</p>
<p>The Northern cucumber tree is another magnolia
whose leaves are tropical-looking. This
is the hardiest of the magnolia family, and its
heart-shaped leaves are six to ten inches long.
They are not large for a magnolia of the South,
but they look larger because they grow among
the small-leaved trees of the Northern states.</p>
<p>The tulip tree has a large leaf of peculiar form.
It is broad like a maple leaf at the base, but at the
tip it is cut off square as if with a pair of shears,
forming a right angle with its straight sides.
Sometimes the leaf is notched, as if a V-shaped
piece were cut out of the square tip. These
leaves are long-stemmed, their blades polished,
and they flutter on the twigs with the lightness
of a poplar leaf. Once we have in mind the
form of the leaf of the tulip tree, we shall never
forget it, for it is different from all other leaves.</p>
<p>The catalpa tree, which lifts its great blossom
clusters above the foliage in late June, is another
of the few large-leaved trees of the North. The
single blade is heart-shaped, six to eight inches
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
long, and more than half as broad. These leaves
usually have plain margins, but sometimes they
are wavy and notched near the base so as to
produce faint side lobes. The blades hang on
long, stout stems.</p>
<p>Among the feather-leaved trees, the walnuts
and butternuts, the sumachs, and the ailanthus,
furnish examples. A black walnut leaf is often
two feet long, with a dozen or more leaflets on
the longest ones. These leaflets are always set
opposite in pairs, with an odd one on the tip
of the leaf stem. Butternut leaves have the same
form, but the leaves are longer. They range
from fifteen to thirty inches, and have from ten
to twenty leaflets, but always an odd number.
The peculiar gummy feeling of these hairy leaves,
and their pungent butternut odour when bruised,
make it easy to know the tree wherever we meet
it, through the long summer.</p>
<p>The hickories are cousins of the walnuts, but
their leaves, though of the feather form, have
larger and fewer leaflets than any walnut tree.
A shagbark hickory leaf has one or two pairs
of little leaflets on the stem, and above them
three of larger size. The pignut has the same
habit of clustering its three largest leaves at the
tip of the leaf stem, and tapering off at the base
with one or two pairs of decreasing size.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>The largest of all the compound leaves have
branched stems to which leaflets are attached.
The main leaf stem&rsquo;s side branches may yet
branch again, forming a twice-branched framework
that is set with leaflets, not large, but so
numerous as to make the whole leaf surprisingly
large. The greatest of these twice-compound
leaves is borne by that astonishing, spiny-stemmed
Hercules&rsquo; club. A single leaf is often
four feet long, and nearly a yard wide. There
are no leaflets on the main stem; they are on
the side branches.</p>
<p>How shall we tell a leaf stem from a twig?
Leaf stems do not look like the twigs of the
tree. A little practice in looking closely and
comparing these leaf stems and twigs will obviate
any confusion of the two. The leaf has
a bud at its base, and it breaks off easily at this
joint.</p>

</div>
<p>Among the fine, feathery leaves that are so
beautiful and light that they give great beauty
to the tree tops are those of the honey locust.
These leaves are of the feather type, the slender
stems, with double rows of tiny leaflets. Very
often we find among the single feather forms,
leaves of greater size, which have branched stems.
This branching multiplies the number of leaflets,
and gives us, on the same trees, what the botanists
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
call <i>once compound</i>, and <i>twice compound</i>
leaves. The simple feather and the branched
feather forms add greatly to the beauty and
luxuriance of the foliage of the honey locust.</p>
<p>The common black locust of the roadside has
single leaf stems with oblong leaflets set in opposite
rows upon it. Ash trees have the same
feather type of leaves, the leaflets usually pointed
and oval, and always an odd one at the tip. They
are all larger than leaves of the locusts.</p>
<p>In the maple family there is a broad, simple
blade, about as wide as it is long. It is a family
trait to have three main veins running out from
the end of the leaf stem, into the blade. Each
of these veins has side branches, and they are
connected with a network of smaller veins. Between
the tips of these three main veins the leaf
is usually notched, so as to divide it into thirds.
In the red maple these notches are shallow V&rsquo;s
cut out, leaving triangular points. In the silver
maple the leaves are cut by deeper clefts, which
reach more than half-way to the leaf stalk. The
three lobes are cut with jagged points into an
uneven margin. The sugar maple has its three
lobes separated by wide, deep clefts, and its margins
are irregularly wavy. The box elder, which
is a maple, is cleft so deeply that the blade is
split into three distinct leaflets, each with its own
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
short stem. This makes a compound leaf of it.
It is the only maple with a leaf of more than
one blade.</p>
<p>The tree which shows the greatest difference
in the form of its leaves is the sassafras, whose
oval leaves grow on the same stem with mittens
and double mittens&mdash;a mitten pattern with a
thumb on each side. The hawthorns have small
oval leaves with variously cleft borders. There
are over a hundred kinds of hawthorns in our
woods, and each kind has a leaf different from
all the rest; yet a single tree will often show
leaves that differ so much from the others in
form that we might easily suspect, if some one
brought them to us, that each grew on a different
tree from all the rest.</p>
<p>Many oak trees have the same habit of leaf
variation, so that even a forester has to examine
many leaves with care, and with them the buds
and the acorns, to make sure that he has called the
oak by its right name.</p>
<p>The behaviour of the leaves of a tree depends
largely on the length and flexibility of their stems.
If they are long, and slender, and supple, the tree-top
is in a continual flutter when the wind blows.
If they are thick and stiff, they do not catch
the breeze as readily, and their blades lie comparatively
still when other trees near by may
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
be twinkling and trembling. Leaves with deeply
cut borders, like some oaks and maples, flutter
much more than leaves like the basswood, whose
borders are unbroken. Oak leaves that are
deeply cut will rarely lie down flat. The curving
bays in its borders cause the leaf to curl, so that
no matter what face is presented, the wind gets
under and strikes some surface, and sets the
leaf to dancing.</p>
<p>The flat leaf stems of the trembling aspen, one
of the poplar family, are very flexible, and they
are flattened at right angles to the blades of the
leaves. When a breeze comes by, it may strike
the edge of the leaf, but if so, it catches the
flat leaf stem broadside. If it comes from any
other direction the leaf trembles, because one of
the blades is sure to receive the force of the
wind. So the tree top is in one constant tremor,
even when the breeze is scarcely sufficient to disturb
broad-leaved trees which are near neighbours
of the aspens.</p>
<p>Whatever the form and size and shape of its
leaf, the tree depends upon its foliage mass for
all the life it enjoys, and for all the growth it
makes. The soil and the air feed the tree. The
leaves and the sun do the work of digesting the
food. In the porous wood and bark are the
channels through which sap mounts upward to
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the leaves, and another set of channels which
carry the prepared food back, leaving it wherever
needed, along the way from tip of twig to
tip of root. Whatever is not needed is stored
away, to be dissolved as needed and carried to
the points where the need is. In spring it is
the growing buds that chiefly need this stored
food. Its presence explains the miracle of the
bursting of blossoms and leaves when spring
comes.</p>
<p>One by one the trees of your own yard may
be learned by name this summer. The leaves
are your sure guide. Trees stay where they are.
Once we recognise their leaves and call them
by name, we may depend upon finding them still
standing the next day we pass them, and their
leaves are still held out as the sign of recognition.
Every time we pass yonder red maple let
us glance at its three-pointed leaf, and fix its
shape indelibly in the mind. When we have done
this a dozen times, I am sure that we shall be
able to pick out all the red maples in town; and
if we journey far from home we may find and
recognise the same kind of trees by the same
sign. More and more as we grow older, we
find out that half the pleasure of travelling is the
occasional meeting with old friends, be they people
or trees.</p>
<h2>TREE STUDIES IN THE SUMMER</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h3 id="c54">TREES WITH THE LARGEST FLOWERS</h3>
<p>If we set out to find the trees that have the
largest flowers, meaning to count only trees
that grow wild in our woods, it will save time
to go straight south into North Carolina, and
climb the foot hills of the Allegheny Mountains.
Or it may be that in the fertile valleys that lie
between the low ridges we shall first come upon
a magnolia, called the large-leaved cucumber tree.
Anywhere from North Carolina to Florida, and
west to Arkansas, these remarkable trees are
likely to be found, in small groups. In cultivation,
they are successfully planted as far north
as Boston.</p>
<p>Before the tree has attained more than a man&rsquo;s
height it is a wonder, on account of the leaves
which measure more than a foot in length, and
have their long, green blades lined with white.
In June the flowers open&mdash;great white bowls,
made of waxen petals, in a double row, the inner
ones painted purple at their bases, giving the
flower a purple centre.</p>
<p>The wind blows the leaves about, and tears
them into rags, unless the tree is in a sheltered
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
place. The silvery leaf linings, as white as the
blossoms, make it difficult to see that the tree is
in bloom, until one is close enough to see the
petals. If the leaves were green on both sides
the great blossoms, as large as a man&rsquo;s head,
would be seen afar off. The tree would look like
a giant rose bush.</p>
<p>From Pennsylvania southward to the Gulf of
Mexico, and west to Arkansas and Texas, the
evergreen magnolia grows on stream borders, and
even on uplands where the soil is not very moist.
When this pyramid of shining green leaves lights
all its waxen tapers, it is a sight worth a day&rsquo;s
journey to see. Each stiff twig is bent upward,
and there a bud appears in spring. A few at
a time, the flowers open, and the blooming time
lasts till August.</p>
<p>Each blossom is a deep, creamy cup, made of
six wax-like petals, surrounded by three white
sepals. Inside are many stamens, purple at the
base, and a cone of pistils, all grown together.</p>
<p>The leaves are oblong or oval, often eight
inches long, thick, deep green, and bright as if
polished on the upper surface. The lining is
dull green, sometimes covered with rusty down.
The paler green and the brighter polish on the
young leaves add much beauty to the tree in
summer. In winter the leaves get grimy and
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
the tree top is sombre, for most of the foliage
has seen much wear and tear.</p>
<p>In autumn the ends of the twigs hold up green
cones, made of many furry capsules that end
in curved horns. Each capsule splits when ripe,
and a scarlet seed, like a berry, hangs out on an
elastic thread, and swings lower and lower, until
finally it is carried away. Thus the magnolia
sows its seeds in winter.</p>
<p>The shining leaves of this magnolia come North
at the Christmas season, and are used to decorate
homes and churches. Holly, mistletoe, palm
leaves, and the beautiful Southern smilax are
other Christmas greens now commonly in use.
They are all gathered with magnolia and shoots
of the long-leaf pine, in the woods down South.</p>
<p>The swamp bay is a magnolia that grows as
a shrub to New England, keeping to the swampy
lands that skirt the Atlantic coast. Every spring
the fragrant, creamy blossoms are to be bought
from street Arabs in New York and Philadelphia.
A single globular flower is surrounded by a whorl
of oval leaves, bright green, but lined with a
white, powdery substance that makes them look
silver-lined. The flowers are deliciously fragrant,
and most beautiful when not spread wide
open. The seller often takes the trouble to
spring the petals back, to make the blossom seem
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
bigger. The waxy petals turn brown soon after
such handling, and all their natural beauty departs.</p>
<p>From Florida westward to Texas this magnolia
becomes a slender, tall evergreen tree. The
best flowers of this tree are borne on shoots that
are produced by pruning back the new growth
each year. The largest leaves and flowers are
also the handsomest.</p>
<p>The cucumber tree is the magnolia of the
North. It is a fine tree in Ontario, Canada, and
from this region it spreads south, its range widening
like a fan, reaching from Arkansas to the
Carolinas, and Mississippi, and Alabama. The
tropical appearance of the tree is due to the big,
heart-shaped leaves. Their tulip-like flowers are
as large as garden tulips, but they make scarcely
any show, because they are very much the same
in colour as the yellowish-green new leaves that
surround them.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;cucumbers&rdquo; are the green cones that
contain the seeds. They are very lumpy and irregular
in form, but when ripe the cells split
open and the scarlet seed, let down on an elastic
thread from each, looks like any magnolia seed.</p>
<p>Cucumber wood is soft, yellowish-brown, and
close-grained. It is not very good lumber,
though put to many uses. The tree is worth
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
more alive than dead. It is an admirable shade
tree, though not planted as much as it deserves.</p>
<p>The tulip tree is a close relative of the magnolias.
It is one of the trees with large flowers,
though, like the cucumber tree, the colour of the
flowers makes them rather inconspicuous. In
June the upturned twigs blossom with yellow tulips.
The three sepals flare outward, the petals
form the cup. A band of orange decorates the
cup, and signals the bees which come for nectar
hidden near the bottom of the flower cup, among
the bases of the many stamens.</p>
<p>Many people see the gay petals of the tulip tree
flowers when they fall on the sidewalk, and some
wonder what these bits of colour are. A few
will say: &ldquo;There must be a tulip tree near by,&rdquo;
and look up to find the singular squared-leaf
blades that belong to no other tree. There is a
whole tree top fluttering with them, and this
tremulous motion explains why the tree is often
called the tulip poplar. The yellow wood gives
the name, yellow poplar. Pulp of this wood is
used for the manufacture of the ordinary postal
cards. It has many other uses, and is a valuable
lumber tree. For shade and ornament it is one
of the best trees to plant.</p>
<p>The cones of the tulip tree do not set free their
seeds, as those of the magnolias do. Instead of
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
horned capsules, the cone has flat, overlapping
blades, like the wing of a maple seed, and the
small, closed seed case is the base of the blade.
A few of these seeds are fully developed. But
when the winter strips the tree of its leaves, the
wind shakes the cones, and the loosened scales
gradually fall. The wind catches the flat wings,
and away they sail. Little tulip trees grow up
where good seeds fall in favourable ground.</p>
<p>One day a neighbour told me that there was
a tree in blossom on the side of the ravine. This
was a strange story, for it was the dead of winter.
We went to see this wonderful tree. What do
you think it was? A tulip tree, with the seed
cones half stripped of their seeds, and shining
like yellow flowers on the ends of the twigs. It
was not strange at all that a person who did
not know the tree, and had never seen its cones
in mid-winter, should make this very mistake.</p>
<p>The flowering dogwood invites us every spring
to break off branches covered with big, white
blossoms, each like a four-pointed star, with a
cluster of small white buds in the centre. The
trees are small and low-branching, their limbs
are flat, and they spread outward and slightly
downward. Who can resist cutting a few of
the blossoming boughs of this lovely tree! The
best part is that the tree suffers not at all if
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the pruning is done with some care. Take a
thought for the tree; cut the branches clean with
a knife. Take them off where they are thick,
and you will leave the tree better in shape than
when you came. Do not strip it of flowers.
This will cripple it. A few sprays of dogwood,
prettily arranged in a vase, are a delight to the
eye. A crowded mass of them is not at all.</p>
<p>The four outer wings of white are not the
petals of a dogwood blossom. They are colourless
leaves, the full-grown scales of the winter
flower buds. The notch at the tip is made by
the falling off of the withered tip which in winter
protected the flowers. The base grew long
and broad and turned gradually white. The bees
see these white banners farther, perhaps, than
they can catch the faint perfume. Watch the
bee as she probes the middle flowers for nectar.
See the pollen on her hairy body. From one to
another, she is the pollen distributor of these
flowers, and she doesn&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<h3 id="c55">TREES MOST SHOWY IN BLOOM</h3>
<p>Sometimes a tree with very small flowers has
such a multitude of them that it attracts more attention
and admiration when in blossom than the
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
trees with the largest flowers. A magnolia blossom
as large as a cabbage head must sacrifice
delicacy to size. We must see it at a distance to
overlook its coarseness, and to escape its overpowering
perfume.</p>
<p>An orchard in early May is transformed into
fairyland by the opening of millions of buds.
Apple trees have just begun to unfold the new
leaves. They are pale green, and coated with
white hairs, so that a silvery cloud rests on the
tree when the white blossoms, warmed with a
tinge of pink, come with a rush that takes one&rsquo;s
breath away.</p>
<p>A single apple blossom has its five flaring petals
inside of five green sepals that are the bud&rsquo;s green
overcoat. The stamens are many; the pistils five
in the centre of the flower. The plan of the
flower is five. The green lump below the blossom
is the apple, already forming. Inside it are
the five cells of the core, and each has its seeds
already forming, if the five pistils have each
caught a grain of pollen for each of the embryo
seeds its chamber of the core contained.</p>
<p>The delicate colour and rich fragrance of the
apple orchard are enchanting. To the honey
bees these two signals call to a feast of nectar.
All unknown to them, they carry pollen on their
furry bodies from flower to flower, and thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
enable the pistils to set seed. If the days are
damp and there are frequent showers while the
apple trees are in bloom, the bees are kept at
home, and there will be but a small crop of
apples. Fortunately for the bees and for us,
the blossoms do not all come out on the same day.
The trees and the bees are hopeful till the last
moment that the sun will shine, and the nectar
be gathered, before the opportunity of the year
passes.</p>
<p>Flowers much like apple blossoms in form
cover the twigs of hawthorn trees. They are
usually in many-flowered clusters, set off by the
green leaves. Fragrance, sometimes sickening
sweet, draws the bees and other insects to these
trees. Nectar drips from the blossoms of some
species. The thorny branches spread sidewise,
holding the blossoms out in wide platforms. The
red fruits, called haws, adorn the trees in late
summer.</p>
<p>Plum and cherry trees are laden with white
bloom, and heavy with fragrance. Some species
haven&rsquo;t a leaf when they bloom. And these are
among the showiest of blossoming trees. In
these flowers there are single pistils, and but a
single grain of pollen is needed to set seed. The
single seed is the pit, or stone, of this family
known as the trees with stone fruits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h3 id="c56">TREES THAT BLOOM IN MIDSUMMER</h3>
<p>In spring the big chestnut tree is late in putting
out its leaves. It is May before the bare
limbs are clothed with green. This crown is
made of long, pointed leaves, each short-stemmed,
strongly ribbed, with parallel veins on each side
of the midrib, polished and sharp-toothed along
its margin. It is a superb dome of unusually
handsome leaves.</p>
<p>When the flower procession is long past and
the grain fields have turned yellow, and the
mower and reaper are humming busily, the chestnut&rsquo;s
crown turns from green to gold, as if to
harmonise with the landscape of midsummer.
Each twig ends in a feathery yellow plume, which
waves in the breezes, and sheds its yellow pollen
abroad. The fertile flowers are at the base of
the plume. As the yellow pollen flowers fade,
the green scaly ones below them are swelling.
They are the young chestnuts. The long tongue
each held out to catch pollen when it was ready
for use. Each flower has three nuts as its full
quota to form. Failure to be pollenated may
cause one of the three to fail. The husk will
then contain two nuts.</p>

</div>
<p>In May the yellow locust trees still stand along
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the roadsides, or herded together along the banks
of streams, bare and ugly, while the trees around
them are beautifully clothed in their green garments,
and adorned with blossoms. The dead
pods still cling to the locust&rsquo;s branches, and not
even the buds are in sight to prove the twigs alive.</p>
<p>Suddenly the trees wake, push out their hidden
buds into shoots which unfold leaves made of
tiny leaflets. The leafy spray is light and graceful,
pale green with a silvery sheen at first. Soon
the leaves are inundated with a flood of white
blossoms, fragrant with their nectar, which hang
in clusters from each twig. The bees see the
white cloud on the locust tree, and hurry to the
feast. Each curious pea-like flower has a honey
pot in its horned petal. Throughout the summer
the locust trees wave their fern-like leaves,
among which the young pods swing, rosy and
green, and velvety soft. The two thorns at the
base of each leaf are there, but they are not conspicuous,
unless you grasp a limb; then they let
you know where they are, and what they can do.</p>
<p>On a summer evening we shall see that the
locust has closed its leaves, folding the opposite
leaflets together, and the whole leaf drooping
from its stem. It reminds us of the old-fashioned
sensitive plant whose leaves resembled these,
folded its leaflets and drooped whenever it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
touched. Indeed, the locust tree and these plants
are near relatives. The locust leaves are sensitive
to the evening air. They close if a rain
comes up, but open when the sun comes out
again and the sky clears.</p>
<p>Locust trees have an insect enemy which bores
into the solid wood, and ruins it for lumber.
Even the twigs are swollen and distorted by these
insects, which feed upon the rich sap that should
go to feed the tree. It is impossible to reach
this enemy with poison, so the trees are helpless.</p>
<p>Except for this unfortunate fact, locusts would
be a profitable crop to raise for timber. Locust
wood is very hard, durable, and strong. It is
slow to decay when in water, so it is valuable
for fence posts, and for boat building. It is
used for hubs and spokes of waggon wheels, and
it is an excellent fuel. The locust timber that
reaches market comes from the mountain slopes,
where the locust-borer is thus far unknown. The
range of the tree is all over the Eastern states
and west to the Rocky Mountains. We shall not
find them south of the latitude of Tennessee.</p>

</div>
<p>The catalpa&rsquo;s great heart-shaped leaves, as
broad as a man&rsquo;s hat, come out in May, but the
leafy shoots grow a foot or more in length, and
it is well along toward Independence Day before
the flower buds show streaks of white above the
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
foliage mass. The upturned twigs end in a
spike of blossoms, creamy in colour, but speckled
within their wide throats with purple and yellow.
The rim of the flower cup is daintily scalloped,
and frilled, and the tree top is even more showy
than the horse chestnut a month earlier.</p>
<p>There is stateliness, even stiffness, in the figure
of a blossoming horse chestnut&mdash;a pyramid of
green holding up a thousand pyramids of white.
The catalpa has a round head, and the loose
flower clusters are quite informal in their arrangement.
The flowers nod gracefully on their
stems&mdash;a thing the horse chestnut flowers are
unable to do.</p>
<p>Why are the dots of colour sprinkled in the
throat of the flower? Why are they arranged
in lines that lead to the nectar sac? To guide
the bees which come in swarms in answer to the
signals of colour and fragrance the flowers fling
out as lures to them.</p>
<p>The two stamens are ripe before the pistil.
The bee rubs the pollen off by crowding into the
flower. Some of this dust is bound to be rubbed
off on the ripe stigma of an older blossom visited
by this bee. Thus, unconsciously the bee helps
the tree to set good seed. Of these we will study
when we come to the tree again in autumn. Only
a hint of the seed vessel is given by looking at
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the oldest flower in a cluster, and noticing the
green part at the base.</p>
<p>The linden or basswood holds its arms out
so that the broad leaves are exposed to the sun
in slanting strata, or platforms of shade, that
strike downward. The tree&rsquo;s frame is roofed
in with them in an almost unbroken thatch of
green. Cattle love to crop this foliage, and to
enjoy the dense shade on a hot day.</p>
<p>In July the dark green is illuminated by thousands
of starry white blossoms, a few at the
end of a slender stem that rises out of a pale
green, leaf-like blade. There is nothing like it
borne on any other tree.</p>
<p>The news that the basswoods are in bloom
reaches the hives in good time. One is able to
hear the murmur of bees as far as he can see
the flowers, but the fragrance travels much
farther. Basswood honey is higher in price than
other kinds. Is this the reason the bees are so
hard at work? Small as the individual flowers
are, they have an unusual supply of nectar, and
the bees revel in the plenty of what will feed
them and yield wax. They make honey while
the sun shines, counting the basswoods their best
source of the crude materials for honeymaking.
It was so in the days of old. Greek poets sang
of the honey-laden lindens. Honey made from
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
linden trees in the Lithuanian forests was carried
to Rome, where it sold for three times the price
of ordinary honey.</p>
<p>Bees swarm, and the new colony often takes
to the woods and sets up housekeeping in a hollow
tree. This is so likely in the Southern states
to be a linden that &ldquo;bee tree&rdquo; is a familiar name
of this tree.</p>
<h3 id="c57">THE EARLY BERRIES IN THE WOODS</h3>
<p>Robins come to our cherry trees in June,
and they hunt for our strawberries under
the green leaves. The blackberries come on,
and the raspberries, and currants. The birds look
at them with calculating eyes. An appetite for
berries is inherited in them, learned in the woods,
where wild berries have grown, and ripened for
them, from the times long before there were
gardens and cultivated fruits.</p>
<p>Back in the woods we shall find wild berries
ripening, and birds feasting thankfully upon
them. The harvest begins with the June-berries
in the month of June. Serviceberries they are
also called, and the tree is known also as the
shadbush. We remember the lovely veil of white
blossoms this tree put on before its leaves came
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
out. In June we might not know the trees, except
that they bear red berries, few on a cluster,
and here the birds are feasting.</p>
<p>There is no other tree with berries that ripen
so early, unless it be the broad-leaved mulberry.
Here, too, the birds will be found in numbers.
Turn back the wide, heart-shaped leaves, and you
will find the single berries of all sizes, some green,
some reddening and soft. They are like blackberries,
each made of many tiny berries, grown
together.</p>
<p>The beauty of the mulberry is that its fruit
keeps coming on from June until August. It
is a very slow, easy-going tree, in no hurry to
have its harvest over. The birds like the soft,
seedy berries, which to our taste are insipid.</p>
<p>It is a shrewd thing to plant mulberry trees
on the edges of fruit gardens, and set a row of
June-berry trees along the road outside the cherry
orchard. It is the scarcity of wild berries that
brings the birds into our gardens. Many a fruit-grower
has saved his crop by planting wild berry
trees for the birds.</p>
<p>The elders are shrubby trees with large, fern-like
leaves. They lift up flat, white flower clusters,
sometimes as large as dinner plates, in June,
and in the middle of summer dark red berries are
ripening where the flowers were. Here is another
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
feast for the birds, and elderberry pies are
the reward of boys and girls who gather the berries,
and take them home to mother. Grandma
thinks of elderberry wine, so good for many ailments,
and if the berries are plenty it is easy to
gather a bucketful to make a few pints of this
old-fashioned cordial.</p>
<p>Among the shining green leaves of the wild
red cherry tree the little fruits glow like rubies
in the summer. Here is a feast for the birds.
We find these small pin cherries very thin-fleshed,
and sour, and the biggest of them is no larger
than a pea. But how the birds love them! The
bird cherry is indeed the bird&rsquo;s tree. In blossom
it belongs to the bees, which come in swarms for
nectar. To them, unconscious carriers of pollen
from flower to flower, the birds owe a debt of
gratitude. They insure the setting of seed, and
this means a big crop of fruit.</p>
<p>The wild black cherry is later with its shining
clusters of dark red cherries. They come in
September, when the birds&rsquo; procession has turned
southward. The earliest comers hold high carnival
in these trees, devour quantities of the bitter-sweet
fruit, and drop the seeds near and far.
The wind can do little in scattering the seeds
of fruit trees. The birds are the chief agents
of distribution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h3 id="c58">THE SASSAFRAS</h3>
<p>The sassafras is not important as a forest
tree, yet I do not know another to whom
so many kinds of people, of all ages, go, asking
for favours this tree alone can give. Even in
regions where the tree does not grow, its name
is well known. Sassafras tea has a world-wide
reputation as a cure for &ldquo;spring fever,&rdquo; otherwise
known as &ldquo;that tired feeling.&rdquo; Drug store
windows are piled high in spring with bits of
the corky bark of the sassafras roots, and the
buds in winter taste of the same aromatic oil,
whose flavour rises from a steaming pot of sassafras
tea. Many a bad-tasting medicine is made
more palatable by a drop or two of oil of sassafras.</p>
<p>The leaves and twigs of young sassafras trees
are used in the South to flavour and thicken
gumbo soups. The wood of sassafras is light
and tough. The long limbs are cut and stripped
by country boys going fishing, who know what
trees yield the best fishing rods. Sassafras posts
last a long while, for the wood does not rot in
contact with soil, or soaked with water. It
makes good boats and barrels for this same reason.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Children know the sassafras tree. In winter
they nibble the dainty green buds, or dig away
the snow at the roots to get a morsel of the
aromatic bark. In summer it is the leaves that
are the chief charm of the tree. It is a fascinating
game to look for the &ldquo;mittens and double
mittens,&rdquo; which seem to be more numerous than
the plain oval leaves on this tree. There is no
other tree that has three distinct leaf shapes.
The mitten form has its thumb just right, on one
side. It might be used for a mitten pattern.
There are lefts and rights, and mittens of all
sizes. The doll-sized ones are the youngest, and
they grow near the tips of the twigs. The double
mittens have a thumb on each side, and the simple
oval shape&mdash;the hand part with no thumb at all&mdash;is
usually harder to find than either of the
others.</p>
<p>When looking for these strange leaf shapes,
there is always a chance of coming upon a strange
inhabitant of the sassafras tree. A great green
caterpillar is lying at ease upon a hammock of
silk, which he has spun for himself. There he
lies, and gazes at the startled person who discovers
him. Are those really eyes, or only black
spots? They probably scare away birds which
are looking for worms. The effect of the two
&ldquo;eye spots&rdquo; is almost as surprising as if two
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
rolling eyeballs glared at the intruder, and threatened
violence if he came near.</p>
<p>Carry home this fearsome green mummy on
the leaf; put him in a cage made of wire screen,
and watch him. He needs no food, for he is
asleep. When he awakes his mummy case will
split open, and out of it will emerge a wonderful
butterfly, with banded wings of black and yellow
velvet, and long, tapering points trailing behind,
which gives him his name&mdash;the swallow-tailed
butterfly. He has a flexible tongue, an inch or
more in length, coiled like a watch spring. With
it he will probe the tubes of flowers, and find
the nectar at the base of each. He is hungry
now, so let him go. Turn him loose in a bed
of flowers, and you may see just how he feeds.</p>
<p>When the mother butterfly laid its tiny green
egg on the face of an open leaf of the sassafras,
the tree was probably in blossom. In June, delicate,
starry, greenish-yellow flowers come out in
clusters on the ends of twigs. The butterfly
finds nectar in these fragrant and dainty blossoms.
In the autumn birds come and feast upon
the blue berries which look very handsome on
their red stems. Indeed, it is quite usual for the
trees to be stripped while the berries are still
green, so hungry are the birds that stop to feed
on their long journey to the South.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>In the autumn the sassafras trees change colour
from the brilliant green of summer. All colours
of the sunset, purple, red, and golden, blend in
these shining tree tops. A clump of sassafras
and sweet gum trees, with here and there a tupelo
and a dogwood, a scarlet oak and a hard
maple, make a picture never to be forgotten. If
the roadside trees were on fire, they would not
show any more vivid colouring. It is their
glorious good-bye to the year, before they all let
their leaves fall and enter into the sleep of winter.</p>
<h3 id="c59">THE ASH FAMILY</h3>
<p>The trees whose leaves are set opposite upon
the twigs are few in the American woods
compared with those whose leaves alternate. The
maples have the opposite arrangement of leaves;
so have the dogwoods. These trees have simple
leaves. The horse chestnuts and buckeyes have
their leaves set opposite, and these leaves are
compound: five or seven leaflets rise from the
end of the stout leaf stem. The ash family is
another large group of trees, with leaves set opposite
on the twigs. These leaves are compound,
but of a different pattern from those of the horse
chestnut. The leaf stem has the leaflets arranged
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
in pairs along its sides. This is the feather
type of compound leaf, seen in the locust family,
and among walnuts and hickories.</p>
<p>Ash trees are recognised by their opposite compound
leaves. There is another sign: the fruit
has a dry seed, pointed and winged like a dart.
There is no other seed exactly like those of the
ash. The seed clusters hang on the bare twigs,
far into winter. The twigs are stout, and set in
pairs on the branches. The trees grow large,
and their tops are regular and handsome. The
bark is close, broken by shallow fissures into
small, often diamond-shaped plates.</p>
<p>Our common ash trees are distinguished by
colour, as the names indicate. A few well-marked
differences are shown by the species, which are
often found growing together in mixed woods.</p>
<p>The white ash is a tall, handsome, stately tree,
with a trunk like a grey granite column. The
white in its name is from the pale leaf linings,
that illuminate the tree top in summer. The twigs
are pale, and the bark is often as pale grey as
that of a white oak. The slender, dart-like seeds
are one to two inches long, with a wing which
is twice the length of the round, tapering seed.
They hang in thick clusters, paler green than
the leaves, and often flushed with a rosy tinge
in late summer. All winter the wind harvests the
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
crop of seeds, and plants young white ashes wherever
the darts fall on good ground.</p>
<p>The black ash is a slender, upright tree, with
narrow head and stout twigs. The plump,
leathery buds on the winter twigs are almost
black, and the bark is a very dark grey. The
foliage in summer is much darker green than
that of any other ash, so the name is earned
by buds, bark, and leaves. The seeds are flat
and short, and the wing is broad and short, and
deeply notched. A black ash leaf has all its
leaflets stemless except the one at the tip. The
white ash has a much fleecier foliage than that
of the black, because each leaflet has a stem of
its own.</p>
<p>The wood of the black ash splits readily
into thin sheets, each representing the growth of
a single year. The Indians taught the white
men to make baskets out of black ash splints.
They cut the tree down, sawed the log into the
lengths required, split the blocks into pieces as
wide as the splints should be. These sticks were
bent over a board, and the strain separated the
bands of dense, tough wood into the thin strips
just right for basket weaving.</p>
<p>The red ash is a small, spreading tree, with a
close head, slender branches, and crowded twigs.
Its bark is reddish, closely furrowed, and scaly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
The young twigs are covered with soft hairs.
The leaves are a shiny yellow-green above, often
a foot long, made of seven to nine slender leaflets,
whose stems and veins have a silky down, that
remains all summer.</p>
<p>Red ash seeds are extremely slender and long,
and they hang on hairy stems.</p>
<p>The green ash has dark, lustrous foliage, the
leaf lining green, like its upper surface. The bark
is grey, and closely checked, and the twigs are
smooth and slender.</p>
<p>This is the ash tree which grows in the regions
of scant rainfall; in Utah, Arizona, and Texas.
In the East it is found from Virginia to Florida.
It is one of the beautiful shade trees in the regions
where few trees grow well. East of the Alleghenies
it is but one among many ash trees, and
is little noticed; but in the far West, and on the
treeless plains of Nebraska and Dakota, it is
a far handsomer tree than its companions, the
willows and the cottonwoods.</p>

</div>
<p>The blue ash is common on the rich river lands
along the principal tributaries of the Mississippi.
Some of the finest specimens grow
on the limestone hills of the Smoky Mountains.
It is a tall, graceful, grey-stemmed ash. We
shall know it anywhere as an ash tree by its
opposite twigs and leaves, and by its dart-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
fruits. It differs from all other ash trees in
having four-angled twigs. The tree has a kind
of blue dye in its inner bark. Cut out a piece
and put it in water, and it is as if you had added
a few grains of indigo.</p>
<p>The blue ash ranks high as a shade tree, and
its wood is quite the equal of white ash. It is
used for vehicles, for flooring, and for tool
handles. It is especially desired for pitchfork
handles.</p>
<p>The native ash of Europe is a large timber
tree, whose range extends through Asia Minor.
The wood of this tree had a wonderful reputation
for general usefulness. Its tough, thin
inner bark was used to write on before paper
was invented. The wood was used for lances
and spears, for bows, pikes, and shields by the
soldiers, during ancient times. Every tool, vehicle,
and implement of the farmer and mechanic
were made of this wood. &ldquo;Every prudent lord
of a manor should employ one acre of ground
with ash to every twenty acres of other land.
In as many years it would be worth more than
the land itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seeds of ash trees were used for fattening
pigs. They were also used as remedies for many
diseases. They were called birds&rsquo; tongues, from
their shape, and every apothecary kept a stock
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
of them. Ash wood makes the best of fuel, and
its ashes, rich in potash, make a splendid fertiliser,
especially in orchards.</p>
<p>One warning the old English rhyme offers regarding
this tree. It is supposed to attract
lightning. Oaks have the same reputation. On
the other hand, tradition holds that a beech tree
is never struck by lightning. There is opportunity,
where these trees grow, and where thunderstorms
are frequent, to notice how true are
the popular beliefs.</p>
<p>Have you ever been warned by this old rhyme?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Beware of the oak, it draws the stroke;</p>
<p class="t0">Avoid the ash, it courts the flash;</p>
<p class="t0">Creep under the thorn&mdash;it will save you from harm.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c60">THE HORSE-CHESTNUT AND THE BUCKEYES</h3>
<p>When an English lad speaks of a chestnut,
he means the horse-chestnut, and the chances are
that he does not know anything about the American
trees, whose sweet nuts we gather in the
woods at home after the frost has opened their
spiny burs. In America the European tree is
planted very commonly for ornament and shade,
and it is always called horse-chestnut here, except
by English cousins who may be visiting us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>They ask us why we put the word &ldquo;horse&rdquo;
before this tree&rsquo;s name. For answer we pull
down a twig, snap off a leaf, and show the scar of
the leaf&rsquo;s attachment to the twig. It is somewhat
like the print of a horse&rsquo;s hoof on the
ground. Even the horseshoe nails are there, for
a thread from each leaflet goes down through
the leaf stem, and its fibres are buried in the
twig. There are five or seven of these nail prints
in the scar, depending upon the number of leaflets.
Five is the usual number, but seven is not
at all unusual.</p>
<p>An old tradition states that the people of Eastern
countries feed these chestnuts to their horses
to cure them of cough, shortness of breath, and
other lung disorders. Upon this is based a second
claim for using the word &ldquo;horse&rdquo; before this
tree&rsquo;s name. The quality of the fruit, however,
is probably the best answer to the question. The
coarse, large nuts are not fit for human food.
It is quite common to think that horses can eat
things too rank for our more fastidious taste.
Horse sugar is the name of a small tree whose
sweetish twigs are browsed upon by cattle and
horses in wooded pastures. Horse-radish and
horse-mint are coarser, more rank-growing kinds
of plants, than their closely related species which
are used for human food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>We shall know the horse-chestnut in the dead
of winter by the large buds, the large hoof-print
leaf scars, and by the pyramidal form of the
tree. The twigs are stout, and they turn upward
so that the largest of the varnished buds are held
up like candles. The main branches leave the
trunk with an upward curve, then bend outward
and downward, then up again to hold the buds
upright. The tree looks, therefore, like a great
complex candlestick, with many arms and many
candles. The twigs are stout, and they come out
opposite each other on the branch. This is a
peculiarity of few trees. It belongs to all of
the members of the horse-chestnut family, which
includes the buckeye trees, our native horse-chestnuts.</p>
<p>In early spring, watch the horse-chestnut tree
outside your windows and along the streets as
they begin to swell, and until they finally open.
The tree lights all its candles when the brown,
varnished outer bud scales fall, and the soft, silky
inner ones, yellow as a candle flame, are revealed.
On the side twigs the buds are smaller than on
the tips. Out of each small bud comes a bunch
of leaves. Out of the big buds come the flowers.</p>
<p>In June a big horse-chestnut tree holds up a
thousand pyramids of white blossoms. Below
each flower duster is an umbrella-like circle of
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
leaves. Each blossom of the dense spike has in
its throat dashes of yellow and red. The petals
form a ruffled border. The curving stamens are
thrust far out. Bees come in search of pollen
and nectar.</p>
<p>After the flowers pass, green fruits appear, a
few in a cluster, and all covered with spines.
Not many of these reach full size. It seems to
be enough for the tree to ripen one or two fruits
in a cluster. In the autumn they turn brown,
and the husk splits into three equal parts. Out
of this spreading husk the brown nuts fall.</p>
<p>Now the boys assail the tree with sticks and
stones, and the harvest of nuts is on. Who does
not love them for their beauty alone? The great
white spot is the place where they were attached
to the husk. The kernel is as bitter as gall, and
I know of no animal which eats it. If any one
counts them useless, let him see the hoards of
them which children gather, and use in their play.
He will change his mind completely. Their
glowing, soft colour is a feast to the eye, and
they just fit the hand.</p>
<h3 id="c61">THE BUCKEYES</h3>
<p>The Ohio buckeye is a little tree, but it has
given its name to the Buckeye State. There must
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
have been many of them in the virgin forest that
the Ohio pioneer cut down to make room for his
crops of corn and grain. He noticed these trees
particularly because of a disagreeable odour that
comes from the bitter sap. The chopping and
handling of these trees intensifies this odour,
which is noticeable even when one drives past a
growing tree.</p>
<p>The name was given by some imaginative person
who saw a resemblance between the smooth
brown nuts and the soft brown eyes of a buck.
The white of the eye corresponds to the dash of
white on the nut. Deer abounded in the virgin
forests, and no doubt it was one of the first
settlers, a hunter as well as a farmer, who named
the tree.</p>
<p>The flowers and leaves resemble those of the
horse-chestnut, but are smaller, as the tree is.
The number of leaflets is five, rarely seven, and
they cluster on the end of a long leaf stem. The
flowers appear in April and May, and are not
conspicuous, for they are yellowish-green, and
make little contrast with the new leaves.</p>
<p>One thing is to be said in favour of this ill-smelling
tree. Its wood has been found to be
the best kind for the making of artificial limbs.
To this special use the lumber is chiefly devoted.</p>
<p>The sweet buckeye lacks the disagreeable odour
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
of the Ohio buckeye, and its nuts are eaten by
cattle. It is a handsome, large tree, with leaves
of five slim leaflets, more or less hairy below,
and on the veins above. The flowers are yellow
and showy. Each corolla is drawn out into a
tube, like a honeysuckle&rsquo;s. The husks of the
nuts are smooth. This species grows from Western
Pennsylvania along the mountain slopes to
Alabama, and on the prairies westward to Iowa.
The nuts are full of starch, and these are ground
into flour, which is used by bookbinders in making
their paste. The reason why this paste is
preferred is that destructive insects do not eat
it as they do paste made of wheat flour.</p>
<p>A red-flowered buckeye tree of small size grows
wild from Missouri to Texas, and east into Tennessee
to Northern Alabama. This is not the
same as the red horse-chestnut, which is sometimes
seen in cultivation as a handsome tree,
twenty to thirty feet high.</p>
<p>In the far West, the California buckeye is a
wide-topped tree of good size, with leaves of the
true horse-chestnut type, and white or rose-coloured
flowers, in showy clusters, and smooth,
pear-shaped nuts. This is the only one of our
native species which grows beyond the Rocky
Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h3 id="c62">THE LOCUSTS AND OTHER POD-BEARERS</h3>
<p>When you find a tree with flat pods, containing
a row of seeds, you may be sure it is a locust,
or one of the family to which locusts belong.
It is a near relative of the peas and beans that
grow in the vegetable garden. This is a great
and valuable family to the human race, for it
furnishes some of the most valuable foods upon
which the people of all countries live. Only one
family, the grasses, is more important. This includes
not only grasses that are used for making
hay, but all the grains&mdash;wheat, barley, rice, oats,
and corn, that make the bread of the world, and
forage crops for horses and cattle. The banana
and sugar cane and bamboos are in this wonderful
grass family.</p>
<p>Along the roadsides, along rivers, and in the
woods grow the black or yellow locusts that
bloom in June, covering their ugly limbs with a
cataract of white, pea-like blossoms, in large clusters.
All summer the slim, thin pods are velvety
and green, with a lovely flush of rose, as they
swing among the feathery, fern-like leaves. In
autumn the pods turn brown, and in winter, when
the wind can switch them against the bare twigs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
they split, and one by one, the hard little seeds
are shaken out. They are too heavy to be carried
in the wind. So we see little locusts coming
up among the old ones, and on the outer edges
of the clump.</p>
<p>No tree is so discouraged-looking, unkempt,
and diseased as a black locust infested with the
borers, and stripped of the foliage that covered
its thin, irregular limbs in the summer time. The
buds, even, are hidden, and the tree looks as if
life had left it. But the late spring denies the
rumour by clothing the dead-looking twigs with
foliage whose tender shadings and delicate leaf
forms make it one of the most graceful and lovely
of all native trees.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot have locusts of this
species in this Eastern country without exposing
them to the attacks of insects against which we
cannot defend the trees. The eggs are laid in
clefts of the bark, and the grubs hatch quite out
of reach of poisons and other damaging spraying
solutions. They feed on the living substance
under the bark, and their presence is shown by
swellings above their burrows. Twigs, limbs,
and trunks are distorted, and gradually the tree
loses vitality, and the wood is made worthless
by the honeycombing it receives. Only in the
mountainous parts of its range does the black
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
locust reach its best growth. No tree has better
lumber for posts and other uses requiring durability
in contact with the soil and with water.</p>
<p>The clammy locust is a pink-flowered species
with a sticky substance exuding from the hairy
surface of new shoots. The flowers are lovely
but scentless. The trees are much planted in
parks and on lawns as an ornament, in all temperate
climates.</p>
<p>The honey locust earns its name in the summer
time, when the curving green pods are full of
a sweet, gelatinous pulp. Boys would like to
get these honey pods, but the vicious thorns permit
no climbing of the trees. Stoning and other
throwing of missiles is a slow and unsatisfactory
means of obtaining the forbidden fruit that hangs
so high. By the time they ripen and fall off
the pods are bitter as gall.</p>
<p>An old-world relative has thick, purple pods,
which are sweet and palatable when ripe. These
are brought to this country, and sold on small
fruit stands under the name, St. John&rsquo;s bread. It
is said that this was the food of John the Baptist
in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The Kentucky coffee tree is the coarsest member
of the locust family in our woods. Its pods
are thick and short, and the seeds inside are as
large as hazel nuts. In the story of the Revolutionary
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
War, the patriotic citizens refused to pay
duties on imported goods. The seeds of this
locust were used as a substitute for coffee. I
have tasted the bitter outside of one of these nuts,
and tried to break one with a hammer, but unsuccessfully.
It is not easy to understand how
a beverage made of such a nut could have been
fit to drink. The name of the tree seems to
give colour of truth to the tradition.</p>
<p>A coffee tree much like our native species
grows in China. We may believe that it is called
by another name, for the people use its heavy
pods for soap. Whether green or ripe, I do not
know.</p>
<p>The club-like branches of our coffee tree give
it a burly, clumsy appearance in winter, when
nothing conceals them from view. The dangling
pods rattle against the bare, stubby twigs, calling
attention to their lack of grace and symmetry.
Even the buds are out of sight, buried under the
thin bark, just above the big leaf scars. All
winter the wind strives with the stubborn pods.
When one is torn off, it lies unopened until melting
snow softens it, and the horny seed lies long
before it is able to sprout.</p>
<p>A thin pod adorns the most delicate of the
locust trees. This is the little red bud, a flat-topped
tree, of slender, thornless branches, most
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of them horizontal. Early in spring this tree
earns its name. Quantities of rosy magenta, pea-shaped
flowers cluster on its slim, angular twigs,
quite covering the smaller branches. It is an
unusual colour, and an unusual time to see pea-blossoms.
You cannot forget it, if you have seen
the tree once.</p>
<p>The leaves that soon follow are as unusual
as the flowers. Roundish, heart-shaped, smooth,
and shining as if polished, they flutter on thin,
flexible stems, and the slim pods hang among
them. They ripen and turn from green to rich
purple when the leaves change to bright yellow.
The hard little seeds are close together in the
pods, so that they are numerous, though the pods
are but two or three inches long.</p>
<p>I do not know when the red bud is most charming.
Certainly its autumn garment of yellow is
beautiful, trimmed with a fringe of purple pods.
It is a royal robe, and so fresh and new-looking
when the foliage of so many larger trees is faded
and in tatters. The trees that hide in the shelter
of larger ones can often save their leaves
from wear and tear, and this the red bud
does.</p>
<p>Judas tree is the name by which the red bud
of Europe is commonly called. It is one of a
few species to which an ugly tradition has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
fastened by custom. It is said that this is the
kind of tree upon which Judas Iscariot hanged
himself. Our little American tree has had to
share the disgrace, for it looks like its European
cousin. The name to use is the true one.</p>
<p>Nurserymen have imported a large-flowered
red bud from China. Its flowers are not only
more showy, but they have a paler, prettier colour&mdash;a
rosy pink, and lacking the sad, blue tone of
the others.</p>
<p>It is easy to raise red bud trees, and they are
admirable in the border planting of a garden or
lawn. They begin to blossom when quite young,
and they never grow so large as to be out of
place among shrubbery.</p>
<p>The yellow-wood has larger and lovelier blossom
clusters than the black locust, with which it
might most easily be confused. In autumn the
flower stems hang full of thin pods, one to three
seeds in a pod. No other locust is so scantily
supplied with seeds in a pod.</p>
<p>In summer the leaflets prove that the tree is
not a black locust. They are larger and fewer,
though of the same feathered type. In the seasons
when the tree blooms freely, which is by
no means every year, the twigs are loaded with
clusters larger than any black locust produces.
In winter it is the bark that distinguishes the
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
tree. It is grey and smooth, like that of the
beech; not at all like the dark trunk and rough
limbs of the locust. The form of the tree is
a regular head of horizontally-spreading limbs,
ending in tapering twigs that droop gracefully.
It is one of the handsomest trees in winter. The
locust is one of the weediest and ugliest of trees
when bare.</p>
<p>To find the yellow-wood in its native haunts,
we must go to the mountains of Eastern Tennessee
and North Carolina. It goes farther
north and south, but its range is scant. Better
chance of our meeting it in our neighbour&rsquo;s yard.
It is cultivated as a flowering tree by people who
appreciate the finest trees that grow wild in American
woods. The nurserymen call it Virgilia.
This is certainly a graceful name, fitted to a tree
that deserves only the best.</p>
<p>The catalpas are pod-bearers of a different type.
Their long pencils are green, and there is no sign
of splitting until autumn. The seeds are not like
those of the flat pods, set in a single row. They
are thin as tissue paper, and packed in overlapping
layers about the thin partition that divides the
pod into two compartments.</p>
<p>The pods hang on after the large, heart-shaped
leaves fall. Winter winds bang them against the
twigs, and their two sides separate lengthwise.
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Gradually the thin, two-winged seeds escape, and
are scattered. The sowing lasts a long time.</p>
<p>Willows and poplars have pods of a sort, but
like neither locusts nor catalpas. The seeds are
very minute in each family, and carried in delicate
wisps of cottony down. The pods open
by splitting down their walls, along two or four
lines, curling back the dry segments, and thus
letting the seeds escape. These trees are early in
scattering their seeds. The true pod-bearers are
late about it.</p>
<h3 id="c63">WILD APPLE TREES AND THEIR KIN</h3>
<p>Go out into the woods, and you will find wild
crab apple trees, bearing hard, sour little apples,
unfit to eat. Four distinct kinds are native to this
country. In Eastern Asia wild apple trees grow
in greater variety than here. Our orchard apple
trees are descended from these Oriental wild
apples, which were brought under cultivation
long before America was discovered. Nurserymen
in Europe and Japan have for centuries
worked with the wild species to improve them.
The Japanese worked to produce finer flowering
trees. European horticulturists desired finer and
larger fruit. American orchards show how well
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
they have succeeded. For over a century American
horticulture has made marked progress.
Many valuable kinds of fruit have originated in
this country. Our own wild apples are now
studied with the aim of bringing them into cultivation,
just as the Asiatic species were improved
centuries ago. It is a wonderful work, accomplished
by crossing, grafting, budding, by fertilising,
and good tillage,&mdash;processes too special
to be explained in this book.</p>
<p>The taming of wild apples, however, is one
of the great achievements of the centuries.
Every boy and every girl who enjoys the eating
of a fine apple will wish to know how such
glorious fruit, in abundance sufficient to supply
the world&rsquo;s needs, has been produced from such
unpromising beginnings as the gnarled little crab
trees scattered through the woods, and dwarfed
by the larger forest trees that overshadowed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grafting&rdquo; or &ldquo;budding&rdquo; a little tree insures
that the fruit it bears later on will be of the
variety of the tree from which the scions came.
Only once in a long while does a good variety
of fruit come on a seedling tree. Plant the seed
of the best apple you ever ate, and then wait a
dozen years or more for this tree to bear fruit.
The chances are ninety-nine to one that the apples
turn out to be miserable, sour, or tasteless nubbins,
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
like the roadside apples, that nobody planted.
It is too expensive to experiment in hope of getting
good varieties from seed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Appleseed&rdquo; was a funny old fellow
who wandered up and down the Ohio valley
states, and planted apple seeds wherever he went.
Queer, and perhaps crazy, he was a kindly soul,
who dreamed of the days when orchards should
dot the landscape, and be a part of every farm
homestead. He did what he could to make the
wild prairie wilderness blossom and bear fruit.
No doubt many pioneer orchards came from his
planting. Seedling trees, all of them, for he believed
firmly that it is <i>wrong</i> to graft a tree!</p>
<p>Each year better and bigger apples are shown
at fairs, and fruit shows. The history of apple
culture is full of interest. It requires hundreds
of books to tell the story. But any man who has
an orchard can tell you how his trees were made
into the varieties he ordered at the nursery. He
may show you how grafting and budding is done,
and how a tree may be made over in a few years
to change entirely the kind of apple it bears.
He may show a tree that bears distinct kinds of
apples on different limbs, and show you the
scar of the graft from which each new variety
has sprung. When you are old enough, you can
grow apple trees from seed, and graft or bud
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
them to the variety you choose,&mdash;greening, russet,
northern spy&mdash;taking your scions from a tree
whose apples are especially fine. It is a fascinating
game to play, with the soil, and the sun,
and the rain all working with you to help you
win.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the wild apple, though worthless as
a fruit tree, is well worth knowing. No well-fed
orchard tree has charm to compare with this
wild thing when spring transforms its ugly,
thorny twigs.</p>
<p>The rosy blossoms of the wild crab apple come
out of a multitude of coral-red buds which open
just after the leaves. The gnarled limbs are
bare and ugly, until late in May. Then the
silvery, velvet leaves unfold, scarcely green at
first, because each one wears so thick a garment
of soft, white hairs. Before the leaves have lost
this velvet coat, the flower buds begin to glow,
and the tree top is soon blushing with the blossoms,
and the air is full of their spicy fragrance.</p>
<div class="img" id="p275">

<p class="center"><span class="small">Nothing tastes so good as ripe apples picked right off the tree!</span></p>
</div>
<p>Their charm is the charm of the wild rose.
Their arrangement on the gnarled twigs is irregular.
The artist loves the unstudied grace of it.
The great botanist, Linn&aelig;us, probably saw only
pressed specimens, but he named the tree <i>coronaria</i>,
which means, &ldquo;fit for crowns and garlands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>I remember gathering the little green apples
in the fall. Hard, and almost bitter, when eaten
out of hand, they make a jelly that is as distinct
and delightful in its way as the flowers are more
admirable than common apple blossoms. The
taste is wild, and almost bitter, but beside it
ordinary apple jelly tastes insipid. Perhaps I
am prejudiced, and the memory of that wild crab-apple
jelly too remote to be depended upon. But
many people agree with me. If you are in the
woods in October, and come to a thicket of trees
bearing flat, yellow apples, pick as many as you
can carry home. Smell their spicy fragrance,
and persuade your mother to make them into
jelly, so that you can form your own opinion
of it.</p>
<p>The Eastern crab apple grows over a large part
of the region between the Atlantic coast, and the
dry plains east of the Rocky Mountains, and
south to Northern Alabama and Texas. The
prairie crab, a different species, grows in the
Mississippi Valley. A narrow-leaved species
grows in the South, and the Oregon crab is
the native wild apple of the woods, from California
north into Alaska.</p>
<p>Quinces are core fruits, cousins of the apples.
So are pears. All of our orchard pears and
quinces are cultivated varieties of species that
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
once grew wild in Europe or Asia. The Japanese
quince in America is a hedge plant which in
spring covers its bare twigs with large, deep rose-coloured
flowers, and bears hard, freckled fruits
that smell better than they taste, in September.
We know all these fruits, and have them in our
gardens, but they are foreigners here, though
much at home. We have no native pears or
quinces in America.</p>
<h3 id="c64">THE CHERRIES</h3>
<p>Do you know the peculiar taste and odour
of the pit of a cherry or peach? Then you will
recognise it without difficulty when you meet it
in a bruised leaf or twig of any tree that bears
stone fruits, wild or cultivated. It belongs to
the family which includes plums, cherries, peaches,
apricots, and almonds. But one species of native
cherry is a large tree. It is chiefly as fruit trees
that the cultivated varieties are important. A
few are grown for their beauty as flowering
trees and shrubs; some for their rich bronze
foliage.</p>
<p>The wild cherry is the one lumber tree in the
family. Its wood ranks with mahogany, though
not so expensive as the tree which grows no
nearer to us than lower Florida and Central
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
America. It is made into furniture or used in
the interior finishing of houses, parlour cars, and
ocean liners. It takes a beautiful polish, and has
a rich brown colour that improves with time.
It is largely used as veneer on cheaper woods.
&ldquo;Solid cherry&rdquo; is likely to be birch, if the
article is of modern make.</p>
<p>This cherry has dark, shiny bark when young,
which breaks into shallow furrows, and curls
back like birch bark. The unquestionable sign
by which to know a wild cherry is the bitter,
peach-pit taste of the sap. Nibble a leaf or
twig or bit of bark, and you get that unforgettable
taste, that stays on the tongue longer than
we like.</p>
<p>Birds feast in September on the long clusters
of dark purple berries. They are bitter sweet,
barely edible, I say. But birds take them thankfully,
and children usually eat them freely. Old-fashioned
people make them into wines or cordials
for home remedies.</p>
<p>The choke cherry is a shrubby tree, with a
rank, disagreeable odour added to the bitter and
pungent odour that belongs to the black cherry.
The leaves are twice as wide as the black cherry&rsquo;s.
The fruit shares the rank quality of the leaves
and bark. Until dead ripe, the cherries are so
bitter, harsh, and puckery that children, who eat
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
the black cherries eagerly, cannot be persuaded
to taste choke cherries a second time. This is
well-named the &ldquo;choke&rdquo; cherry. Only the birds
can eat the berries without choking. They seem
not to mind its rankness, for the fruit is all
taken by the time it has turned black-ripe.</p>
<p>Early in summer the red bird cherry is in
fruit, after its crown of white blossoms has
passed. The pit is large, and the flesh thin and
sour, and the whole fruit is discouragingly small.
But birds are happy among the shining leaves
until the last cherry is gone. This is quite
sufficient appreciation. The seeds are dropped,
and the little trees come up all through the woods
and in the most unexpected places, due to the
birds&rsquo; scattering of the seeds.</p>
<p>Garden cherries of the sweet and sour groups
have sprung from wild species that grow in
Europe. The red, black, and yellow cherries
of California are the largest, most improved
varieties. The garden cherries of the Eastern
states are not nearly so large.</p>
<p>The native cherry of Japan has been cultivated
as a flowering tree, until it is wonderfully
beautiful. In its season of bloom, Japan is a
perfect fairyland. The country is one great
garden of pink cherry blossoms. At this time
the people turn out to see the marvellous sight.
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
A national holiday is dedicated to this tree, which
is the symbol of happiness in the Flower Kingdom.</p>
<h3 id="c65">THE PLUMS</h3>
<p>All plum trees are small in stature, and many
are thorny by the sharpening of side twigs, as
if the struggle with adverse conditions made it
necessary to carry weapons of defence. I speak
now of the wild species. They grow in thickets,
another habit of self-protection.</p>
<p>The wild red and yellow plums that still
grow in thickets along streams in the great middle
country between the East coast and the Rocky
Mountains, furnished an important article of food
to the pioneer families, which led the westward
march of civilisation, and founded the prairie
states. Only people who remember those times,
and actually took part in the work of the pioneer,
can know how valuable the wild fruits were,
while the young orchards were growing, and no
fruit was to be had for the greater part of the
year.</p>
<p>After the first heavy frost in September the
plums were fit to eat. They became soft, and
sweet, and pleasant in flavour. But the skin was
thick, very sour and puckery, so eating plums
was not an unmixed joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>When a team and part of the family could be
spared from the farm work, a day was taken
for &ldquo;plumming,&rdquo; and a happy and laborious
day it was, but always enjoyed in true holiday
spirit. Usually neighbours joined in the outing,
and had a picnic dinner together in the woods.
Only the oldest clothes were worn, for in the plum
thickets one must risk the ruin of his raiment
by the angular, thorny branches. Sheets were
spread under the trees where possible, and a
severe shaking or beating of the branches showered
the fruit down. All hands were busy at
gathering the plums, and loading the waggons
with the harvest.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was time afterward for the boys
to explore the hazel thickets, and gather a generous
bagful of these small, but deliciously flavoured
nuts, still in their husks. Wild grape vines,
loaded with the purple fruit, tempted the frugal
wife to strip them, even though the sun was low.
For days after the return home, she was at work
putting away for winter use preserves and jellies
and pickles, and good old-fashioned plum and
grape &ldquo;butter,&rdquo; sweetened with molasses made
from sorghum cane.</p>
<p>Little plum trees, dug in the woods in early
spring, were planted in the home garden. By
setting these carefully, and tilling and enriching
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the soil around them, larger trees and finer fruit
were produced than the wild plum thicket could
show. Some of the good cultivated plums have
had such an origin.</p>
<p>A half dozen different species of wild plum
grow wild in different soils and regions of the
United States. Where two grow in the same
territory, natural hybrids have originated, better
than either parent in the quality of their fruit.
Such a cross has given rise to several varieties
of garden plums, of which the Miner group is a
fair example. The best orchard plums for the
middle of the country are crosses between native
and Japanese species. The European species,
like Damsons and Green Gages, do well in the
Eastern states, and on the Pacific slope.</p>
<p>The prunes we buy are dried plums. For a
century or two France has led all countries in
the prune industry. Now California leads. The
kinds of plums that can be dried are sweet and
fleshy. Ordinary juicy plums cannot be made
into prunes. The hot sun of California soon
takes all the moisture out of the plums spread
on tables to dry. There is no rain to fear in
the hot summer months.</p>
<p>Peaches, nectarines, and apricots are stone
fruits, closely related to the plums and peaches.
These Old World fruits are grown in the warm
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
parts of this country. California raises them in
quantities. The most profitable of the stone
fruits has woody flesh, and is raised for its pit,
which we eat. This is the sweet almond, a
valuable nut. Its related species, the bitter
almond, yields almond oil and hydrocyanic acid,
both important drugs.</p>
<h3 id="c66">THE SERVICEBERRIES</h3>
<p>In the same family with apples and plums and
cherries is a group of slender, pretty trees called
June berry, serviceberry, and on the East coast,
shadbush. When the shadbush blossoms white,
the fishermen know that it is time to expect the
shad, which are taken in nets when they run up
the rivers to spawn. The red berries are ripe
in June, and the birds celebrate the event, and
even take them before they begin to redden.
Competition is strong, and the supply never equals
the demand. Rarely can a human berry-picker
find a ripe berry, to discover how it tastes.</p>
<p>The charm of this little tree is that it covers its
slim branches so early with white blossoms.
The clusters are soft and feathery, and a warm
flush underlies the white, the ruddy, strap-shaped
bracts, two of which are under each flower. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
dainty opening leaves are also ruddy, and these
have opened before the blossoms pass.</p>
<p>In early April it is worth a long walk or drive
through the woods to see the scattered serviceberry
trees standing out from the bare background
of leafless trees, lovely as any tree can ever be,
in their robes of white. Thereafter, they seem
to retire from view, engulfed by the foliage curtain
the woodland draws about itself, as spring
advances.</p>
<h3 id="c67">VALUABLE SAP OF TREES</h3>
<p>In early spring on the New Hampshire hillsides,
the sap begins to mount the trunks of
the sugar maple trees, dissolving the sugar stored
in the wood cells during the previous summer.
It is time for the making of maple sugar. Winter
is over. Spring work has begun.</p>
<p>Hundreds of twigs of elder have been cut in
short lengths, and the pith pushed out, to make
&ldquo;spiles.&rdquo; Holes are bored in the trunks of the
trees, and in each hole one of these hollow spiles
is driven. These are the little spouts that drain
the sap from the tree into the waiting buckets that
stand or hang below. Drip, drip, drip, the sweet
sap flows into the buckets; and as often as they
fill, the farmer makes the rounds of the trees
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
with barrels on a low sled or &ldquo;stone boat,&rdquo;
emptying the buckets.</p>
<p>The sap he gathers is poured into the evaporating
pans in the sugar house, and a roaring fire
keeps it boiling. As the water goes off in steam,
the remainder becomes maple syrup, which
thickens as it boils. Skimming and straining
removes any dirt or chips that fall into the sap.
When it is just thick enough, the syrup is drawn
off into cans, and sealed to be sent to market.
A part of it, however, is boiled longer, and when
drawn off, and cooled, it crystalises into the
granular yellow maple sugar. It is cooled in
shallow pans that hold a certain amount, and
thus the bricks of maple sugar are formed. Little
heart-shaped cakes are made by filling &ldquo;patty
pans&rdquo; with this heavy syrup.</p>
<p>As long as the sap flows in sufficient quantities,
the sugar harvest goes on. If the trees are
bored with care, with holes not too close together,
the tree will stand this draining from year to
year, and seem not to be injured by the loss of
sap. If the holes are close together, and extend
all around the trunk, the tree will be practically
girdled and it will die from the injury.</p>
<p>The finest kind of maple sugar is the wax
which is made by pouring heavy syrup on the
snow to cool. Quickly it thickens by the cold
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
into stringy yellow wax, which tastes like other
maple sugar, but does not have the unpleasant
gritty feeling, which sets some teeth on edge.
Maple wax may be made at home, by melting
the sugar, and pouring it into snow; but the
time and the place to enjoy it most, is in the
sugar camp when the hot syrup is poured from
the long-handled ladle onto the nearest snow
bank by the person who is in charge of the
boiling. The cold air of the woods puts a keen
edge on the appetite. The warm fire under the
boiler takes off the chill, and the silent woods
all around give a charm to the scene which one
does not feel in any other place.</p>
<p>Hickory sap is sweet. This is sometimes added
to that of the maples when maple trees are
scarce.</p>
<p>The sap of pine trees is a liquid called <i>resin</i>.
The pine forests of the South are rich stores
of this resin, which we call also pitch. The crude
liquid drained from these trees is heated, and a
light liquid called <i>turpentine</i> is drawn off. The
remainder hardens, and is known as <i>rosin</i>. The
pine trees are tapped, not as the sugar trees of the
North are, but in a way that is far more injurious
to the trees. Resin hardens into gum when exposed
to the air, so it is impossible to draw it
out through small tubes like spiles of elder that
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
drain the maple sap. A great gash is cut in
the side of the trunk of a pine tree, forming a
pocket holding three pints or more. Now a
square foot or more of the bark above the pocket
is cut off, and the wood is chipped to a depth
of an inch or more. The bleeding surface of the
wood fills the pocket below with resin, and a
man comes around with pails and dipper to empty
these pockets as fast as they fill. The pails are
carried to a still, where the resin is poured into
a tank and heated to draw off the limpid turpentine.</p>
<p>Once a week, from March till November, more
bark and wood, above the scored surface, must
be chipped to renew the flow of resin. If this
fresh wounding did not occur, the flow would
cease, because the resin thickens and hardens
when exposed to the air. This stops up the pores
of the wood.</p>
<p>Fortunes have been made by the draining of
these pine trees of their rich, pitchy sap. Turpentine
and tar and rosin are all products of the
sap of pines, and all are immensely valuable,
especially in shipyards, and in the provisioning
of sea-going craft of all sorts. The term, &ldquo;naval
stores,&rdquo; has been applied to the products of turpentine
gathering. Our forests supply most of
these products to other countries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>The sap of certain tropical trees hardens into
rubber. This is one of the most valuable of tree
crops, for there is hardly a household that does
not have rubber articles of a dozen kinds that
are daily used. Lacquer varnish is the juice of
certain sumach trees that grow in Japan. Gums
of fir trees have a special use in medicine, and in
various arts.</p>
<p>Sweet gum oozes from trees of that name.
This is not noticeable in our trees of the North,
but if we follow the trees southward, the gum
flow increases. In Mexico it is an article of
commerce, obtained by wounding the bark of
the trees. It is one of the staple glove perfumes
in France. It is also made into medicines, perfumes,
and incense.</p>
<p>The sap of wild cherry, holly, and buckthorn,
of witch hazel and sassafras all yield medicinal
drugs. The flowers of locust, of basswood, and
all the fruit trees furnish nectar out of which
bees make honey. The juicy inner bark of the
slippery elm is valuable for food, and as a medicine.</p>
<h3 id="c68">THE USES OF TREES</h3>
<p>Imagine a stranger who has lived all his life
in a desert where no trees grow, coming suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
into our village, and looking with wonder at
the trees that shade the streets. He knows only
the spiny cactuses, and other plants of the desert.
His first question would be, &ldquo;What are these
great plants that stand so tall?&rdquo; The name, <i>tree</i>,
is new to him. It would be a strange experience
to take such an eager and ignorant man and
show him the trees, on the streets, planted in
orchards, and growing wild in the woods outside
of the town. His questions set us to thinking.
He wants to know why we plant trees, and how
we use those that grow in forests.</p>
<p>First, we tell him the uses of the living trees.
Up and down the streets they are set for shade,
and for their beauty. Rows of evergreens set
close together make a protecting wall of green
against the cold winds. Low clipped hedges of
many kinds of trees make living boundaries, much
more beautiful than wooden or wire fences. On
lawns and near houses trees are planted for
their beauty and for their shade. Orchards of
fruit trees are planted because they furnish food.
Nut orchards are set out for the same reasons.</p>
<p>The trees cut down in the woods, and sawed
at the mills give us lumber to build houses to live
in, and furniture to make them comfortable,
and the same forest furnishes the fuel that keeps
us warm. There is so much to explain to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
person who discovers trees for the first time. It
takes a long time to tell all we know.</p>
<p>Do we think that we know a great deal about
the uses of trees? If so, we are mistaken. The
truth is that trees serve us in ways of which we
have never dreamed.</p>
<p>We must travel over the world and read a
great deal to learn how the people of other
countries make use of trees. The basswood or
linden which nobody cared to use except for fuel
in the Middle West might pass for a useless tree,
compared with those whose wood is harder and
stronger. But in older countries people have
quite a different opinion of the tree.</p>
<p>In Russia the tough bark of young lindens is
used to make the shoes of peasants. Ropes,
fishing nets, and braided mats are made from the
same tough &ldquo;bast&rdquo; fibres, which are very long
and tough in this family of trees. The seeds
yield oil that is declared to be quite as good as
olive oil for cooking, and for the table. Perfume
is distilled from the flowers. Cattle browse on
the twigs and leaves. The wood is the carver&rsquo;s
delight&mdash;soft, white, free from knots and imperfections.
It is used for bureau drawers, carriage
bodies, shoe soles, barrel staves and paper pulp.
Its twigs make artist&rsquo;s charcoal pencils.</p>
<p>Linden trees are planted for shade in many
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
countries, and in Europe they are often cut into
grotesque shapes of animals as they grow. They
are clipped into hedges, as close as box or yew.
In America they are usually allowed to grow
naturally, as shade trees. European species are
rather more symmetrical than our native kinds.</p>
<p>The Indians of the Northwest used the soft
inner bark of the tamarack pine for food. They
cut down the trees, strip them of bark, and
scraped out this soft lining layer. With water,
they mash it into a pulp, which they cook and
then mould into large cakes. A hole is next
dug in the ground, lined with stones, and a fire
is built in it. When the stones are hot, all ashes
are removed, and the cakes, wrapped in green
skunk cabbage leaves, are laid in. A fire of
damp moss is built on top, and thus the cakes are
thoroughly, baked. To insure their keeping, they
are next smoked in a close tent for a week or
more. This dries and cures them so that they
may be safely packed away for future use.
These hard, dry cakes are afterward broken into
pieces and boiled. When the mass softens and
cools, it is ready to eat. The fat of different
animals is used for butter on this strange Alaskan
bread.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">The delicate white flower clusters of the serviceberry tree</span></p>
</div>
<p>Everybody knows that trees bear fruits of
many kinds that are useful as food for men and
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
beasts. Spices, such as nutmegs, mace, cloves,
and allspice, may be added to this list of fruits
which we have as human foods.</p>
<p>The bark of birches is invaluable to the Indians
for the making of their canoes, baskets, and all
kinds of utensils. Huts and teepees are walled
with it. Rope and coarse cloth are made out of
the fibre of mulberry bark, and berry baskets out
of the bark of the lodgepole pine. The fibrous
roots of the larch tree furnished tough thread,
with which the Indians sewed canoes of birch,
and they made them water-tight with the gum
of the balsam. The brown gum that oozes from
wounds of the Western larch is sweet and
starchy. The Indians discovered in it a valuable
article of food.</p>
<p>One of the latest uses of wood is the making
of paper, although the white hornet showed in
its conical paper nest that this could be done.
She has been making wooden paper for hundreds
of years, scraping the wood from the surface of
weathern-worn fence boards, and from the dead
limbs of forest trees. Our newspapers are made
of ground wood, cooked to a soft pulp, and
rolled out into thin sheets. The high price of
paper makes it worth while to gather up papers,
bleach them, convert them into pulp, and
roll them out again into sheets. Spruce wood
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and poplar are among the cheap woods which
have come into demand at the paper mills. The
forests of these trees, counted of little use for
lumber, have become valuable because the paper
mills can use them.</p>
<p>Look about the room, and a dozen articles,
beside the chairs and table, are products of wood,
or in some way owe a debt to trees. The paint
that covers the window sash and frames was
mixed with turpentine, which is obtained from the
pitchy sap of pine trees. The shades and curtains
are coloured. Dyes of many kinds are extracted
from the various dyewoods, trees that
grow in tropical forests. The newspaper and
the books on the shelves are made of wood pulp.
The lacquered box from Japan is a handsome
thing. The lacquer varnish is the sap of a
certain Oriental sumach tree. The perfume of
the gloves in the box is made from the fragrant
gum of an Oriental sweet gum tree. The skin
out of which the gloves were made was tanned,
not with bark, but with the acorn cups, or galls,
of a European oak.</p>
<p>The shoes on your feet are made of leather.
The hemlock trees that grow on the hills were
stripped of their bark by peelers in early spring.
Black oak and chestnut oak are also stripped in
our woods. Carloads of bark are shipped to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
tanneries to be used in the tanning of skins which
changes them into leather.</p>
<p>That beautiful book upon the table is bound
in Russia leather. The acorn cups of a European
oak were used to tan the skins that made
this leather so much more beautiful than that
of your shoes. Your gloves are made of kid
skins tanned in Europe. For this particular
work the nut-like galls that grow on certain oak
trees are gathered in the woods.</p>
<p>Tannin is the substance in oak bark which
makes it valuable in tanning leather. A high percentage
of tannin is found in oak galls. For this
reason they are gathered in many countries, and
are among the most valuable and high-priced
supplies for the establishments that tan skins for
gloves. The most expensive inks and dyes, those
that do not fade, but are practically permanent,
are made from selected oak galls.</p>
<p>Oak apples are a strange fruit, found in more
or less abundance on the leaves of our own oak
trees in autumn. You have seen them in summer
time, plump, green balls, sometimes as large as
a hen&rsquo;s egg, but globular, sitting upon a leaf.
In autumn the balls take on the colour of the
dying leaves.</p>
<p>The same tree may have hard little marble-like
balls growing on its twigs. These are of
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
different sizes, and it is not unusual to find a hole
in the side of each.</p>
<p>All such outgrowths on the leaves and twigs
of oaks are called galls, and they are chiefly
caused by winged insects called gall-gnats. An
egg is laid in early spring, in a slit pierced in the
twig or leaf. As this egg hatches, the tissue
about it is disturbed in its growth by the presence
of this feeding grub. The soft leaf pulp, or the
tender tissues of the twig that surround it, are
exactly what the grub likes to eat. Food and
drink are all about it, and as it feeds, it grows.
The leaf swells, and so surrounds the grub with
an abnormal growth. The grub still feeds, and
the swelling becomes larger, until finally, when
the insect ceases to eat, it is housed in the peculiar
ball which we know as an oak gall. Each species
of gall-maker is known by its house.</p>
<p>The oak apples are of several kinds. Some
are empty except for a little shell in the centre,
in which the fat grub sleeps. Sometimes the
substance within the &ldquo;apple&rdquo; is corky, sometimes
spongy. Bullet galls, which form on twigs like
little marbles, are usually solid to the centre,
where the grub lies until the time comes for it to
bore its way out to the surface, and fly away, to
lay eggs which will produce other galls. Usually
oak galls, found in winter, contain the sleeping
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
grub, whose transformation into a winged insect
waits until the coming of spring.</p>
<p>The cork in your ink bottle is the bark of
an oak tree. Go to Portugal or to Northern
Africa, and you may see the cork harvest in
progress in July or August. There is no place
to go for genuine cork except to a small evergreen
oak that rarely reaches a height over thirty
feet. When these trees are twenty-five years old,
a hard, thin layer of bark is stripped off. This
is a valuable tan bark, but it is not in the least
corky. The tree now produces a spongy bark
entirely different from the first. It is not disturbed
for eight or ten years. This is stripped
off. It is the poor quality of bark which fishermen
use to float their nets with.</p>
<p>Ten years later the bark is stripped again.
It is better in quality than the first. Each ten
years brings the bark stripper again to the tree.
In the fiftieth year, the bark is of the finest
quality, and for fifty years that follow there are
five strippings of bark of the highest grade.
Then the quality becomes poorer. The trees are
cut down, the bark is sold to the tanners, and
the wood is used for charcoal or for fuel.</p>
<p>It is a very particular job to get the cork off
and leave the under layer uninjured. The trunk
is stripped from the ground to the point where
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
it branches, and the inner &ldquo;mother bark&rdquo; must
not be bruised, for no more cork will grow on
any bruised spot. Two circular cuts are made,
one at the top, one at the bottom of the columnar
trunk, then two opposite slits are made dividing
the bark of the trunk into two halves. These
curved plates are worked off by inserting a
wedged-shaped tool between the bark and the
trunk, and gradually working it further in until
the whole curved plate of cork comes off. These
two big sheets are steamed and flattened, then
bound in bundles, and shipped to wholesale
dealers in cork.</p>
<p>The owner of a grove of cork oaks must wait
ten years between crops of the bark, but every
year three crops of acorns are borne on these
trees. The pigs of the owner, turned into the
grove, fatten on this rich food. So the little
trees are very profitable in two ways.</p>
<p>In the south of Europe, the handsome, evergreen
holm oak grows wild; its glossy leaves and
compact form remind us of our holly trees. It
is one of the most valuable ornamental oaks,
but as a fruit tree, it has unusual value. Its
acorns are sweet and rich, and the crop is heavy.
Hogs are fattened upon them. In earlier days
they were used as human food, and even now
gipsies gather them to eat. Its acorn cups, bark,
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and the galls it bears are of the very best quality.
They are used in the most particular jobs of
dyeing and tanning.</p>
<p>Under ground, the holm oak bears a strange
fruit&mdash;a fungus called &ldquo;truffle&rdquo; develops on the
roots. These truffles are somewhat like mushrooms
in their growth. They are far more delicious
to eat, and expensive to buy than ordinary
mushrooms. The best of them are found in
France, and French people are especially fond
of them.</p>
<p>Trees that grow on chalky lands are more
likely to produce truffles. At a dozen years old,
they begin to yield, and truffles may be found
upon their roots for about twenty-five years.</p>
<p>Not every holm oak has truffles on its roots.
The finding of these delicacies is a very interesting
and exciting game, and a great deal of a lottery.
There is but one way to find them, and that is by
the sense of smell. The truffle has a rich, strong
odour. Dogs and pigs are the only animals that
are able to find it. The truffle-hunter is usually
an old woman, who goes with a trained pig or a
trained dog into the oak forest. She has a basket,
and a spading fork, and she keeps a close eye on
her four-footed partner. If the pig, in rooting
about under an oak, suddenly becomes excited, and
begins to root furiously, she drives him away, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
digs out the precious ball of fungus he has
scented. It is irregular in form, and looks somewhat
like a potato. Meanwhile the pig locates
another, and is again disappointed. The truffle
dog is treated in the same manner. Unless put
into a pen, or chained at night, these truffle-hunters
are likely to take to the woods and feast
when no one is by to interfere with their pleasure.</p>
<p>Truffles are shipped in cans to the United
States, but we have not yet discovered them growing
on the roots of our oak trees. Probably we
have not yet looked for them with sufficient care
and patience.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
